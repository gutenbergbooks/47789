<h2 class="p4">PREFACE</h2>

<p class="pc1">&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN PREPARING this book of short stories concerning
the doctor’s daily life, the editor has availed himself
of the counsel of his staff of editorial associates,
and he trusts that this volume will prove equally acceptable
as the other works in <span class="smcap">The Doctor’s Recreation
Series</span>.</p>

<p>The stories themselves are offered without critical
comment. Many of them are old favorites. Many of
them are by well-known and standard authors. All
relate some episode in the doctor’s life in a manner
both striking and original. We believe this is the
first volume of its kind ever offered to the public.</p>

<p>For the courtesy of copyright privileges extended
we return thanks to S. S. McClure Co., The Century
Co., Harper &amp; Brothers, J. B. Lippincott Co., Little,
Brown &amp; Co., Macmillan &amp; Co., John Brisben Walker,
Joseph Kirkland, Dr. Conan Doyle, Lucy S. Furman,

Stuart, Margaret Sutton Briscoe, Henry Seton Merriman,

<p class="drop-capi">“POOR Abe Dodge.”</p>

<p class="pn">That’s what they called him, though he
wasn’t any poorer than other folks&mdash;not so
poor as some. How could he be poor, work as he did
and steady as he was? Worth a whole grist of such
bait as his brother, Ephe Dodge, and yet they never
called Ephe poor&mdash;whatever worse name they might
call him. When Ephe was off at a show in the village,
Abe was following the plough, driving a straight
furrow, though you wouldn’t have thought it to see
the way his nose pointed. In winter, when Ephe was
taking the girls to singing school or spelling bee or
some other foolishness&mdash;out till after nine o’clock at
night, like as not&mdash;Abe was hanging over the fire,
holding a book so the light would shine, first on one
page and then on the other, and he turning his head
as he turned the book, and reading first with one eye
and then with the other.</p>

<p>There, the murder’s out! Abe couldn’t read with
both eyes at once. If Abe looked straight ahead he
couldn’t see the furrow&mdash;nor anythin’ else, for that
matter. His best friend couldn’t say but what Abe
Dodge was the cross-eyedest cuss that ever was. Why,
if you wanted to see Abe, you’d stand in front of
him; but if you wanted Abe to see you, you’d got to
stand behind him, or pretty near it. Homely? Well,
if you mean downright “humbly,” that’s what he
was. When one eye was in use the other was out of
sight, all except the white of it. Humbly ain’t no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
name for it: The girls used to say he had to wake up
in the night to rest his face, it was so humbly. In
school you’d ought to have seen him look down at his
copybook. He had to cant his head clear over and
cock up his chin till it pointed out of the winder and
down the road. You’d really ought to have seen him,
you’d have died. Head of the class, too, right along;
just as near to the head as Ephe was to the foot; and
that’s sayin’ a good deal. But to see him at his desk!
He looked for all the world like a week-old chicken,
peekin’ at a tumble-bug! And him a grown man,
too, for he stayed to school winters so long as there
was anything more the teacher could teach him. You
see, there wasn’t anything to draw him away; no girl
wouldn’t look at him&mdash;lucky, too, seein’ the way he
looked.</p>

<p>Well, one term there was a new teacher come&mdash;regular
high-up girl, down from Chicago. As bad
luck would have it, Abe wasn’t at school the first
week&mdash;hadn’t got through his fall work. So she got
to know all the scholars, and they was awful tickled
with her&mdash;everybody always was that knowed her.
The first day she come in and saw Abe at his desk,
she thought he was squintin’ for fun, and she upped
and laughed right out. Some of the scholars laughed
too, at first; but most of ‘em, to do ‘em justice, was a
leetle took back; young as they was, and cruel by
nature. (Young folks is most usually always cruel&mdash;don’t
seem to know no better.)</p>

<p>Well, right in the middle of the hush, Abe gathered
up his books and upped and walked outdoors, lookin’
right ahead of him, and consequently seeing the
handsome young teacher unbeknown to her.</p>

<p>She was the worst cut up you ever did see; but what
could she do or say? Go and tell him she thought he
was makin’ up a face for fun? The girls do say that
come noon-spell, when she found out about it, she
cried&mdash;just fairly cried. Then she tried to be awful
nice to Abe’s ornery brother Ephe, and Ephe he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
tickled most to death; but that didn’t do Abe any
good&mdash;Ephe was jest ornery enough to take care that
Abe shouldn’t get any comfort out of it. They do
say she sent messages to Abe, and Ephe never delivered
them, or else twisted ‘em so as to make things
worse and worse. Mebbe so. mebbe not&mdash;Ephe was
ornery enough for it.</p>

<p>‘Course the school-ma’am she was boardin’ round,
and pretty soon it come time to go to ol’ man Dodge’s,
and she went; but no Abe could she ever see. He
kept away, and as to meals, he never set by, but took
a bite off by himself when he could get a chance.
(’Course his mother favored him, being he was so
cussed unlucky.) Then when the folks was all to
bed, he’d come in and poke up the fire and peek into
his book, but first one side and then the other, same
as ever.</p>

<p>Now what does school-ma’am do but come down one
night when she thought he was a-bed and asleep, and
catch him unawares. Abe knowed it was her, quick
as he heard the rustle of her dress, but there wasn’t
no help for it, so he just turned his head away and
covered his cross-eyes with his hands, and she pitched
in. What she said I don’t know, but Abe he never
said a word; only told her he didn’t blame her, not a
mite; he knew she couldn’t help it&mdash;no more than he
could. Then she asked him to come back to school,
and he answered to please excuse him. After a bit
she asked him if he wouldn’t come to oblige her, and
he said he calculated he was obligin’ her more by
stayin’ away.</p>

<p>Well, come to that she didn’t know what to say or
do, so, woman-like, she upped and cried; and then she
said he hurt her feelings. And the upshot of it was
he said he’d come, and they shook hands on it.</p>

<p>Well, Abe kept his word and took up schoolin’ as
if nothing had happened; and such schoolin’ as there
was that winter! I don’t believe any regular academy
had more learnin’ and teachin’ that winter than what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
that district school did. Seemed as if all the scholars
had turned over a new leaf. Even wild, ornery, no-account
Ephe Dodge couldn’t help but get ahead
some&mdash;but then he was crazy to get the school-ma’am;
and she never paid no attention to him, just went with
Abe. Abe was teachin’ her mathematics, seeing that
was the one thing where he knowed more than she did&mdash;outside
of farmin’. Folks used to say that if Ephe
had Abe’s head, or Abe had Ephe’s face, the school-ma’am
would have half of the Dodge farm whenever
ol’ man Dodge got through with it; but neither of
them did have what the other had, and so there it was,
you see.</p>

<p>Well, you’ve heard of Squire Caton, of course;
Judge Caton, they call him since he got to be Judge
of the Supreme Court&mdash;and Chief Justice at that.
Well, he had a farm down there not far from Fox
River, and when he was there he was just a plain
farmer like the rest of us, though up in Chicago he
was a high-up lawyer, leader of the bar. Now it so
happened that a young doctor named Brainard&mdash;Daniel
Brainard&mdash;had just come to Chicago and was
startin’ in, and Squire Caton was helpin’ him, gave
him desk-room in his office and made him known to
the folks&mdash;Kinzies, and Butterfields, and Ogdens, and
Hamiltons, and Arnolds, and all of those folks&mdash;about
all there was in Chicago in those days. Brainard
had been to Paris&mdash;Paris, France, not Paris, Illinois,
you understand&mdash;and knew all the doctorin’
there was to know then. Well, come spring, Squire
Caton had Doc Brainard down to visit him, and they
shot ducks and geese and prairie chickens and some
wild turkeys and deer, too&mdash;game was just swarmin’
at that time. All the while Caton was doin’ what law
business there was to do; and Brainard thought he
ought to be doin’ some doctorin’ to keep his hand in,
so he asked Caton if there wasn’t any cases he could
take up&mdash;surgery cases especially he hankered after,
seein’ he had more carving tools than you could shake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
a stick at. He asked him particularly if there wasn’t
anybody he could treat for “strabismus.” The squire
hadn’t heard of anybody dying of that complaint; but
when the doctor explained that strabismus was
French for cross-eyes, he naturally thought of poor
Abe Dodge, and the young doctor was right up on his
ear. He smelled the battle afar off; and ‘most before
you could say Jack Robinson the squire and the doctor
were on horseback and down to the Dodge farm,
tool-chest and all.</p>

<p>Well, it so happened that nobody was at home but
Abe and Ephe, and it didn’t take but few words
before Abe was ready to set right down, then and
there, and let anybody do anything he was a mind to
with his misfortunate eyes. No, he wouldn’t wait till
the old folks come home; he didn’t want to ask no
advice; he wasn’t afraid of pain, nor of what anybody
could do to his eyes&mdash;couldn’t be made any
worse than they were, whatever you did to ‘em. Take
‘em out and boil ‘em and put ‘em back if you had a
mind to, only go to work. He knew he was of age and
he guessed he was master of his own eyes&mdash;such as
they were.</p>

<p>Well, there wasn’t nothing else to do but go ahead.
The doctor opened up his killing tools and tried to
keep Abe from seeing them; but Abe he just come
right over and peeked at ‘em, handled ‘em, and called
‘em “splendid”&mdash;and so they were, barrin’ havin’
them used on your own flesh and blood and bones.</p>

<p>Then they got some cloths and a basin, and one
thing an’ another, and set Abe right down in a chair.
(No such thing as chloroform in those days, you’ll
remember.) And Squire Caton was to hold an instrument
that spread the eyelid wide open, while Ephe
was to hold Abe’s head steady. First touch of the
lancet, and first spirt of blood, and what do you
think? That ornery Ephe wilted, and fell flat on the
floor behind the chair!</p>

<p>“Squire,” said Brainard, “step around and hold his
head.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can hold my own head,” says Abe, as steady as
you please. But Squire Caton, he straddled over
Ephe and held his head between his arms, and the two
handles of the eye-spreader with his hands.</p>

<p>It was all over in half a minute, and then Abe he
leaned forward, and shook the blood off his eye-lashes,
and looked straight out of that eye for the first time
since he was born. And the first words he said were:</p>

<p>“Thank the Lord! She’s mine!”</p>

<p>About that time Ephe he crawled outdoors, sick as
a dog; and Abe spoke up, says he:</p>

<p>“Now for the other eye, doctor.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” says the doctor, “we’d better take another
day for that.”</p>

<p>“All right,” says Abe; “if your hands are tired of
cuttin’, you can make another job of it. My face
ain’t tired of bein’ cut, I can tell you.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you’re game, I am.”</p>

<p>So, if you’ll believe me, they just set to work and
operated on the other eye, Abe holding his own head,
as he said he would, and the squire holding the
spreader. And when it was all done, the doctor was
for putting a bandage on to keep things quiet till the
wounds all healed up, but Abe just begged for one
sight of himself, and he stood up and walked over to
the clock and looked in the glass, and says he:</p>

<p>“So that’s the way I look, is it? Shouldn’t have
known my own face&mdash;never saw it before. How long
must I keep the bandage on, doctor?”</p>

<p>“Oh, if the eyes ain’t very sore when you wake up
in the morning, you can take it off, if you’ll be careful.”</p>

<p>“Wake up! Do you s’pose I can sleep when such
a blessing has fallen on me? I’ll lay still, but if I
forget it, or you, for one minute this night, I’ll be so
ashamed of myself that it’ll wake me right up!”</p>

<p>Then the doctor bound up his eyes and the poor
boy said “Thank God!” two or three times, and they
could see the tears running down his cheeks from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
under the cloth. Lord! It was just as pitiful as a
broken-winged bird!</p>

<p>How about the girl? Well; it was all right for
Abe&mdash;and all wrong for Ephe&mdash;all wrong for Ephe!
But that’s all past and gone&mdash;past and gone. Folks
come for miles and miles to see cross-eyed Abe with
his eyes as straight as a loon’s leg. Doctor Brainard
was a great man forever after in those parts. Everywhere
else, too, by what I heard.</p>

<p>When the doctor and the squire come to go, Abe
spoke up, blind-folded as he was, and says he:</p>

<p>“Doc, how much do you charge a feller for savin’
his life&mdash;making a man out of a poor wreck&mdash;doin’
what he never thought could be done but by dyin’
and goin’ to kingdom come?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” says Doc Brainard, says he, “that ain’t
what we look at as pay practice. You didn’t call me
in; I come of myself, as though it was what we call a
clinic. If all goes well, and if you happen to have a
barrel of apples to spare, you just send them up to
Squire Caton’s house in Chicago, and I’ll call over
and help eat ‘em.”</p>

<p>What did Abe say to that? Why, sir, he never
said a word; but they do say the tears started out
again, out from under the bandage and down his
cheeks. But then Abe he had a five-year-old pet mare
he’d raised from a colt&mdash;pretty as a picture, kind as
a kitten, and fast as split lightning; and next time
Doc come down Abe he just slipped out to the barn
and brought the mare round and hitched her to the
gate-post, and when Doc come to be going, says Abe:</p>

<p>“Don’t forget your nag, doctor; she’s hitched at
the gate.”</p>

<p>Well, sir, even then Abe had the hardest kind of a
time to get Doc Brainard to take that mare; and when
he did ride off, leadin’ her, it wasn’t half an hour before
back she came, lickety-split. Doc said she broke
away from him and put for home, but I always suspected
he didn’t have no use for a hoss he couldn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
sell or hire out, and couldn’t afford to keep in the village&mdash;that
was what Chicago was then. But come
along towards fall Abe he took her right up to town,
and then the doctor’s practice had growed so much
that he was pretty glad to have her; and Abe was
glad to have him have her, seeing all that had come
to him through havin’ eyes like other folks&mdash;that’s the
school-ma’am, I mean.</p>

<p>How did the school-ma’am take it? Well, it was
this way. After the cuttin’ Abe didn’t show up for
a few days, till the inflammation got down and he’d
had some practice handlin’ his eyes, so to speak. He
just kept himself to himself, enjoying himself. He’d
go around doin’ the chores, singin’ so you could hear
him a mile. He was always great on singin’, Abe
was, though ashamed to go to singin’-school with the
rest. Then, when the poor boy began to feel like
other folks, he went right over to where school-ma’am
happened to be boardin’ round, and walked right up
to her and took her by both hands, and looked her
straight in the face, and said:</p>

<p>“Do you know me?”</p>

<p>Well, she kind of smiled and blushed, and then the
corners of her mouth pulled down, and she pulled one
hand away, and&mdash;if you believe me&mdash;that was the
third time that girl cried that season, to my certain
knowledge&mdash;and all for nothin’ either time!</p>

<p>What did she say? Why, she just said she’d have
to begin all over again to get acquainted with Abe.
But Ephe’s nose was out of joint, and Ephe knowed
it as well as anybody, Ephe did. It was Abe’s eyes
to Ephe’s nose.</p>

<p>Married? Oh, yes, of course; and lived on the farm
as long as the old folks lived, and afterwards, too;
Ephe staying right along, like the fool he always had
been. That feller never did have as much sense as a
last year’s bird’s nest.</p>

<p>Alive yet? Abe? Well, no. Might have been if it
hadn’t been for Shiloh. When the war broke out Abe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
thought he’d ought to go, old as he was, so he went
into the Sixth. Maybe you’ve seen a book written
about the captain of Company K of the Sixth. It
was Company K he went into&mdash;him and Ephe. And
he was killed at Shiloh&mdash;just as it always seems to
happen. He got killed, and his worthless brother
come home. Folks thought Ephe would have liked to
marry the widow, but, Lord! she never had no such
an idea! Such bait as he was compared to his brother.
She never chirked up, to speak of, and now she’s dead
too, and Ephe he just toddles round, taking care of
the children&mdash;kind of a he dry-nurse that’s about all
he ever was good for, anyhow.</p>

<p>My name? Oh, my name’s Ephraim&mdash;Ephe they
call me, for short; Ephe Dodge. Abe was my brother.</p>

<h2 class="p2">THE DOCTOR’S OF HOYLAND.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dcd.jpg" width="100" height="120" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi120">DR. JAMES RIPLEY was always looked upon
as an exceedingly lucky dog by all of the
profession who knew him. His father had
preceded him in a practice in the village of Hoyland,
in the north of Hampshire, and all was ready for him
on the very first day that the law allowed him to put
his name at the foot of a prescription. In a few
years the old gentleman retired and settled on the
South Coast, leaving his son in undisputed possession
of the whole countryside. Save for Dr. Horton, near
Basingstoke, the young surgeon had a clear run of
six miles in every direction, and took his fifteen
hundred pounds a year; though, as is usual in country
practice, the stable swallowed up most of what the
consulting-room earned.</p>

<p>Dr. James Ripley was two and thirty years of age,
reserved, learned, unmarried, with set, rather stern,
features, and a thinning of the dark hair upon the
top of his head, which was worth quite a hundred a
year to him. He was particularly happy in his management
of ladies. He had caught the tone of bland
sternness and decisive suavity which dominates without
offending. Ladies, however, were not equally
happy in their management of him. Professionally,
he was always at their service. Socially, he was a
drop of quicksilver. In vain the country mammas
spread out their simple lures in front of him. Dances
and picnics were not to his taste, and he preferred
during his scanty leisure to shut himself up in his
study, and to bury himself in Virchow’s Archives
and the professional journals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Study was a passion with him, and he would have
none of the rust which often gathers round a country
practitioner. It was his ambition to keep his knowledge
as fresh and bright as at the moment when he
had stepped out of the examination hall. He prided
himself on being able, at a moment’s notice, to rattle
off the seven ramifications of some obscure artery, or
to give the exact percentage of any physiological
compound. After a long day’s work he would sit up
half the night performing iridectomies and extractions
upon the sheep’s eyes sent in by the village
butcher, to the horror of his housekeeper, who had
to remove the <i>débris</i> next morning. His love for his
work was the one fanaticism which found a place in
his dry, precise nature.</p>

<p>It was the more to his credit that he should keep
up to date in his knowledge, since he had no competition
to force him to exertion. In the seven years during
which he had practised in Hoyland, three rivals
had pitted themselves against him; two in the village
itself, and one in the neighboring hamlet of Lower
Hoyland. Of these, one had sickened and wasted,
being, as it was said, himself the only patient whom
he had treated during his eighteen months of ruralizing.
A second had bought a fourth share of a Basingstoke
practice, and had departed honorably; while a
third had vanished one September night, leaving a
gutted house and an unpaid drug bill behind him.
Since then the district had become a monopoly, and
no one had dared to measure himself against the
established fame of the Hoyland doctor.</p>

<p>It was, then, with a feeling of some surprise and
considerable curiosity that, on driving through Lower
Hoyland one morning, he perceived that the new
house at the end of the village was occupied, and that
a virgin brass plate glistened upon the swinging gate
which faced the highroad. He pulled up his fifty-guinea
chestnut mare, and took a good look at it.
“Verrinder Smith, M. D.,” was printed across it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
very neat, small lettering. The last man had had
letters half a foot long, with a lamp like a fire station.
Dr. James Ripley noted the difference, and
deduced from it that the newcomer might possibly
prove a more formidable opponent. He was convinced
of it that evening when he came to consult the current
medical directory. By it he learned that Dr.
Verrinder Smith was the holder of superb degrees,
that he had studied with distinction at Edinburgh,
Paris, Berlin and Vienna; and, finally, that he had
been awarded a gold medal and the Lee Hopkins
scholarship for original research in recognition of an
exhaustive inquiry into the functions of the anterior
spinal nerve roots. Dr. Ripley passed his fingers
through his thin hair in bewilderment as he read his
rival’s record. What on earth could so brilliant a
man mean by putting up his plate in a little Hampshire
hamlet?</p>

<p>But Dr. Ripley furnished himself with an explanation
to the riddle. No doubt Dr. Verrinder Smith
had simply come down there in order to pursue some
scientific research in peace and quiet. The plate was
up as an address rather than as an invitation to
patients. Of course, that must be the true explanation.
In that case the presence of this brilliant neighbor
would be a splendid thing for his own studies.
He had often longed for some kindred mind, some
steel on which he might strike his flint. Chance had
brought it to him, and he rejoiced exceedingly.</p>

<p>And this joy it was which led him to take a step
which was quite at variance with his usual habits. It
is the custom for a newcomer among medical men to
call first upon the older, and the etiquette upon the
subject is strict. Dr. Ripley was pedantically exact
on such points, and yet he deliberately drove over
next day and called upon Dr. Verrinder Smith. Such
a waiving of ceremony was, he felt, a gracious act
upon his part, and a fit prelude to the intimate relations
which he hoped to establish with his neighbor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>The house was neat and well appointed, and Dr.
Ripley was shown by a smart maid into a dapper little
consulting-room. As he passed in he noticed two
or three parasols and a lady’s sunbonnet hanging in
the hall. It was a pity that his colleague should be a
married man. It would put them upon a different
footing, and interfere with those long evenings of
high scientific talk which he had pictured to himself.
On the other hand, there was much in the consulting-room
to please him. Elaborate instruments,
seen more often in hospitals than in the houses of private
practitioners, were scattered about. A sphygmograph
stood upon the table, and a gasometer-like
engine, which was new to Dr. Ripley, in the corner.
A bookcase full of ponderous volumes in French and
German, paper-covered for the most part, and varying
in tint from the shell to the yolk of a duck’s
egg, caught his wondering eyes, and he was deeply
absorbed in their titles when the door opened suddenly
behind him. Turning round he found himself
facing a little woman, whose plain, palish face was
remarkable only for a pair of shrewd, humorous eyes
of a blue which had two shades too much green in it.
She held a <i>pince-nez</i> in her left hand and the doctor’s
card in her right.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Dr. Ripley?” said she.</p>

<p>“How do you do, madam?” returned the visitor.
“Your husband is perhaps out?”</p>

<p>“I am not married,” said she, simply.</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon! I meant the doctor&mdash;Dr.
Verrinder Smith.”</p>

<p>“I am Dr. Verrinder Smith.”</p>

<p>Dr. Ripley was so surprised that he dropped his
hat and forgot to pick it up again.</p>

<p>“What!” he gasped, “the Lee Hopkins prize man!
You!” He had never seen a woman doctor before,
and his whole conservative soul rose up in revolt at
the idea. He could not recall any Biblical injunction
that the man should remain ever the doctor and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
woman the nurse, and yet he felt as if a blasphemy
had been committed. His face betrayed his feelings
only too clearly.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to disappoint you,” said the lady,
dryly.</p>

<p>“You certainly have surprised me,” he answered,
picking up his hat.</p>

<p>“You are not among our champions, then?”</p>

<p>“I cannot say that the movement has my
approval.”</p>

<p>“And why?”</p>

<p>“I should much prefer not to discuss it.”</p>

<p>“But I am sure you will answer a lady’s question.”</p>

<p>“Ladies are in danger of losing their privileges
when they usurp the place of the other sex. They cannot
claim both.”</p>

<p>“Why should a woman not earn her bread by her
brains?”</p>

<p>Dr. Ripley felt irritated by the quiet manner in
which the lady cross-questioned him.</p>

<p>“I should much prefer not to be led into a discussion,
Miss Smith.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Smith,” she interrupted.</p>

<p>“Well, Dr. Smith! But if you insist upon an
answer, I must say that I do not think medicine a
imitable profession for women, and that I have a personal
objection to masculine ladies.” It was an
exceedingly rude speech, and he was ashamed of it
the instant after he had made it. The lady, however,
simply raised her eye-brows and smiled.</p>

<p>“It seems to me that you are begging the question,”
said she. “Of course, if it makes women masculine,
that would be a considerable deterioration.”</p>

<p>It was a neat little counter, and Dr. Ripley, like a
picked fencer, bowed his acknowledgment. “I must
go,” said he.</p>

<p>“I am sorry that we can not come to some more
friendly conclusions, since we are to be neighbors,”
she remarked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>He bowed again, and took a step toward the door.</p>

<p>“It was a singular coincidence,” she continued,
“that at the instant that you called I was reading
your paper on ‘Locomotor Ataxia’ in the ‘Lancet.’”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said he dryly.</p>

<p>“I thought it was a very able monograph.”</p>

<p>“You are very good.”</p>

<p>“But the views which you attribute to Professor
Pitres of Bordeaux have been repudiated by him.”</p>

<p>“I have his pamphlet of 1890,” said Dr. Ripley,
angrily.</p>

<p>“Here is his pamphlet of 1891.” She picked it
from among a litter of periodicals. “If you have time
to glance your eye down this passage&mdash;”</p>

<p>Dr. Ripley took it from her and shot rapidly
through the paragraph which she indicated. There
was no denying that it completely knocked the bottom
out of his own article. He threw it down, and
with another frigid bow he made for the door. As
he took the reins from the groom, he glanced round
and saw that the lady was standing at her window,
and it seemed to him that she was laughing heartily.</p>

<p>All day the memory of this interview haunted him.
He felt that he had come very badly out of it. She
had shown herself to be his superior on his own pet
subject. She had been courteous while he had been
rude, self-possessed when he had been angry. And
then, above all, there was her presence, her monstrous
intrusion, to rankle in his mind. A woman doctor had
been an abstract thing before, repugnant, but distant.
Now she was there in actual practice, with a brass
plate up just like his own, competing for the same
patients. Not that he feared the competition, but he
objected to this lowering of his ideal of womanhood.
She could not be more than thirty, and had a bright,
mobile face too. He thought of her humorous eyes,
and of her strong, well-turned chin. It revolted him
the more to recall the details of her education. A
man, of course, could come through such an ordeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
with all his purity, but it was nothing short of
shameless in a woman.</p>

<p>But it was not long before he learned that even her
competition was a thing to be feared. The novelty of
her presence had brought a few curious invalids into
her consulting-rooms, and, once there, they had been
so impressed by the firmness of her manner, and by
the singular new-fashioned instruments with which
she tapped and peered and sounded, that it formed
the core of their conversation for weeks afterward.
And soon there were tangible proofs of her powers
upon the countryside. Farmer Eyton, whose callous
ulcer had been quietly spreading over his shin for
years back, under a gentle régime of zinc ointment,
was painted round with blistering fluid, and found,
after three blasphemous nights, that his sore was
stimulated into healing. Mrs. Crowder, who had
always regarded the birthmark upon her second
daughter, Eliza, as a sign of the indignation of the
Creator at a third helping of a raspberry tart which
she had partaken of during a critical period, learned
that, with the help of two galvanic needles, the mischief
was not irreparable. In a month Dr. Verrinder
Smith was known, and in two she was famous.</p>

<p>Occasionally Dr. Ripley met her as he drove upon
his rounds. She had started a high dog-cart, taking
the reins herself, with a little tiger behind. When
they met he invariably raised his hat with punctilious
politeness, but the grim severity of his face showed
how formal was the courtesy. In fact, his dislike was
rapidly deepening into absolute detestation. “The
unsexed woman” was the description of her which he
permitted himself to give to those of his patients who
still remained stanch. But, indeed, they were a
rapidly decreasing body, and every day his pride was
galled by the news of some fresh defection. The lady
had somehow impressed the country folk with an
almost superstitious belief in her power, and from
far and near they flocked to her consulting-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>But what galled him most of all was when she did
something which he had pronounced to be impracticable.
For all his knowledge, he lacked nerve as an
operator, and usually sent his worst cases up to London.
The lady, however, had no weakness of the
sort, and took everything that came in her way. It
was agony to him to hear that she was about to
straighten little Alec Turner’s club foot, and right at
the fringe of the rumor came a note from his mother,
the rector’s wife, asking him if he would be so good
as to act as chloroformist. It would be inhumanity to
refuse, as there was no other who could take the place,
but it was gall and wormwood to his sensitive nature.
Yet, in spite of his vexation, he could not but admire
the dexterity with which the thing was done. She
handled the little wax-like foot so gently, and held
the tiny tenotomy knife as an artist holds his pencil.
One straight incision, one snick of a tendon, and it
was all over without a stain on the white towel which
lay beneath. He had never seen anything more masterly,
and he had the honesty to say so, though her
skill increased his dislike of her. The operation
spread her fame still farther at his expense, and self-preservation
was added to his other grounds for
detesting her.</p>

<p>And this very detestation it was which brought
matters to a curious climax. One winter’s night, just
as he was rising from his lonely dinner, a groom came
riding down from Squire Faircastle’s, the richest man
in the district, to say that his daughter had scalded
her hand, and that medical help was needed on the
instant.</p>

<p>The coachman had ridden for the lady doctor; for it
mattered nothing to the squire who came, as long as it
were speedily. Dr. Ripley rushed from his surgery
with the determination that she should not effect an
entrance into this stronghold of his if hard driving on
his part could prevent it. He did not even wait to
light his lamps, but sprang into his gig and flew off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
as fast as hoofs could rattle. He lived rather nearer
to the Squire’s than she did, and was convinced that
he could get there well before her.</p>

<p>And so he would but for that whimsical element of
chance, which will forever muddle up the affairs of
this world and dumfound the prophets. Whether it
came from the want of his lights, or from his mind
being full of the thoughts of his rival, he allowed
too little by half a foot in taking the sharp turn upon
the Basingstoke road. The empty trap and the
frightened horse clattered away into the darkness,
while the Squire’s groom crawled out of the ditch into
which he had been shot. He struck a match, looked
down at his groaning companion, and then, after the
fashion of rough, strong men when they see what they
have not seen before, he was very sick.</p>

<p>The Doctor raised himself a little on his elbow in
the glint of the match. He caught a glimpse of something
white and sharp bristling through his trouser-leg,
half way down the shin.</p>

<p>“Compound!” he groaned. “A three months’
job,” and fainted.</p>

<p>When he came to himself the groom was gone, for
he had scudded off to the Squire’s house for help, but
a small page was holding a gig-lamp in front of his
injured leg, and a woman, with an open case of polished
instruments gleaming in the yellow light, was
deftly slitting up his trouser with a crooked pair of
scissors.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Doctor,” said she, soothingly. “I
am so sorry about it. You can have Dr. Horton
to-morrow, but I am sure you will allow me to help
you to-night. I could hardly believe my eyes when I
saw you by the roadside.”</p>

<p>“The groom has gone for help,” groaned the sufferer.</p>

<p>“When it comes we can move you into the gig. A
little more light, John! So! Ah, dear, dear, we shall
have laceration unless we reduce this before we move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
you. Allow me to give you a whiff of chloroform, and
I have no doubt that I can secure it sufficiently to&mdash;”</p>

<p>Dr. Ripley never heard the end of that sentence.
He tried to raise a hand and to murmur something in
protest, but a sweet smell was in his nostrils, and a
sense of rich peace and lethargy stole over his jangled
nerves. Down he sank, through clear, cool water,
ever down and down into the green shadows beneath,
gently, without effort, while the pleasant chiming of
a great belfry rose and fell in his ears. Then he rose
again, up and up, and ever up, with a terrible tightness
about his temples, until at last he shot out of
those green shadows and was out in the light once
more. Two bright shining golden spots gleamed
before his dazed eyes. He blinked and blinked before
he could give a name to them. They were only the
two brass balls at the end posts of his bed, and he was
lying in his own little room, with a head like a cannon-ball,
and a leg like an iron bar. Turning his
eyes, he saw the calm face of Dr. Verrinder Smith
looking down at him.</p>

<p>“Ah, at last!” said she. “I kept you under all the
way home, for I knew how painful the jolting would
be. It is in good position now, with a strong side
splint. I have ordered a morphia draught for you.
Shall I tell your groom to ride for Dr. Horton in the
morning?”</p>

<p>“I should prefer that you should continue the
case,” said Dr. Ripley feebly, and then, with a half-hysterical
laugh, “You have all the rest of the parish
as patients, you know, so you may as well make the
thing complete by having me also.” It was not a
very gracious speech, but it was a look of pity and not
of anger which shone in her eyes as she turned away
from his bedside.</p>

<p>Dr. Ripley had a brother William, who was assistant
surgeon at a London hospital, and who was down in
Hampshire within a few hours of his hearing of the
accident. He raised his brows when he heard the
details.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“What! You are pestered with one of those!” he
cried.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I should have done without
her.”</p>

<p>“I’ve no doubt she’s an excellent nurse.”</p>

<p>“She knows her work as well as you or I.”</p>

<p>“Speak for yourself, James,” said the London man
with a sniff. “But apart from that, you know that
the principle of the thing is all wrong.”</p>

<p>“You think there is nothing to be said on the other
side?”</p>

<p>“Good heavens! do you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know. It struck me during the night
that we may have been a little narrow in our views.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, James. It’s all very fine for women to
win prizes in the lecture-room, but you know as well
as I do that they are no use in an emergency. Now I
warrant that this woman was all nerves when she was
setting your leg. That reminds me that I had better
just take a look at it and see that it is all right.”</p>

<p>“I would rather that you did not undo it,” said the
patient; “I have her assurance that it is all right.”</p>

<p>Brother William was deeply shocked.</p>

<p>“Of course, if a woman’s assurance is of more value
than the opinion of the assistant surgeon of a London
hospital, there is nothing more to be said,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“I should prefer that you did not touch it,” said
the patient firmly, and Dr. William went back to London
that evening in a huff. The lady, who had heard
of his coming, was much surprised on learning of his
departure.</p>

<p>“We had a difference upon a point of professional
etiquette,” said Dr. James, and it was all the explanation
he would vouchsafe.</p>

<p>For two long months Dr. Ripley was brought in contact
with his rival every day, and he learned many
things which he had not known before. She was a
charming companion, as well as a most assiduous doctor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Her short presence during the long weary day
was like a flower in a sand waste. What interested
him was precisely what interested her, and she could
meet him at every point upon equal terms. And yet
under all her learning and her firmness ran a sweet,
womanly nature, peeping out in her talk, shining in
her greenish eyes, showing itself in a thousand subtle
ways which the dullest of men could read. And he,
though a bit of a prig and a pedant, was by no means
dull, and had honesty enough to confess when he was
in the wrong.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how to apologize to you,” he said in
his shamefaced fashion one day, when he had progressed
so far as to be able to sit in an armchair with
his leg upon another one; “I feel that I have been
quite in the wrong.”</p>

<p>“Why, then?”</p>

<p>“Over this woman question. I used to think that a
woman must inevitably lose something of her charm if
she took up such studies.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t think they are necessarily unsexed,
then?” she cried, with a mischievous smile.</p>

<p>“Please don’t recall my idiotic expression.”</p>

<p>“I feel so pleased that I should have helped in
changing your views. I think that it is the most sincere
compliment that I have ever had paid me.”</p>

<p>“At any rate, it is the truth,” said he, and was
happy all night at the remembrance of the flush of
pleasure which made her pale face look quite comely
for the instant.</p>

<p>For, indeed, he was already far past the stage when
he would acknowledge her as the equal of any other
woman. Already he could not disguise from himself
that she had become the one woman. Her dainty skill,
her gentle touch, her sweet presence, the community of
their tastes, had all united to hopelessly upset his previous
opinions. It was a dark day for him now when
his convalescence allowed him to miss a visit, and
darker still that other one which he saw approaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
when all occasion for her visits would be at an end.
It came around at last, however, and he felt that his
whole life’s fortune would hang upon the issue of that
final interview. He was a direct man by nature, so he
laid his hand upon hers as it felt for his pulse, and he
asked her if she would be his wife.</p>

<p>“What, and unite the practices?” said she.</p>

<p>He started in pain and anger. “Surely you do not
attribute any such base motive to me,” he cried. “I
love you as unselfishly as ever a woman was loved.”</p>

<p>“No, I was wrong. It was a foolish speech,” said
she, moving her chair a little back, and tapping her
stethoscope upon her knee. “Forget that I ever said
it. I am so sorry to cause you any disappointment,
and I appreciate most highly the honor which you do
me, but what you ask is quite impossible.”</p>

<p>With another woman he might have urged the point,
but his instincts told him that it was quite useless with
this one. Her tone of voice was conclusive. He said
nothing, but leaned back in his chair a stricken man.</p>

<p>“I am so sorry,” she said again. “If I had known
what was passing in your mind I should have told you
earlier that I intend to devote my life entirely to
science. There are many women with a capacity for
marriage, but few with a taste for biology. I will remain
true to my own line then. I came down here
while waiting for an opening in the Paris Physiological
Laboratory. I have just heard that there is a
vacancy for me there, and so you will be troubled no
more by my intrusion upon your practice. I have
done you an injustice, as you did me one. I thought
you narrow and pedantic, with no good quality. I
have learned during your illness to appreciate you
better, and the recollection of our friendship will always
be a very pleasant one to me.”</p>

<p>And so it came about that in a very few weeks there
was only one doctor in Hoyland. But folks noticed
that the one had aged many years in a few months,
that a weary sadness lurked always in the depths of
his blue eyes, and that he was less concerned than ever
with the eligible young ladies whom chance, or their
careful country mammas, placed in his way.</p>

<h2 class="p2">DOCTOR SANTOS: A CHARACTER SKETCH.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dce.jpg" width="100" height="118" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi110">EVERY one in Madrid knew Doctor Santos. He
was a little bit of a man, with his beard and
hair clamoring for the use of the scissors, and
his clothes for benzine and a more fashionable cut.
Nevertheless, he had a universal reputation for great
wisdom, and his popularity in the district of Chamberi,
the principal scene of his work, was beyond
everything.</p>

<p>Possibly the peculiarities of the doctor did more
than his true merit to attract the attention of the people.
Perhaps some presentiment made every one consider
him physically of not much account, but mentally
a diamond of the purest water. It was well known
that in the exercise of his profession he was a true
ministering angel, and without any pretence of being
a specialist or a philanthropist. People said that he
was half crazy over the subject of disease, and followed
the development of a fever with the same interest
that others listened to or read a dramatic work,
but with this exception, that it was not always necessary
to be a mere spectator, that by discreetly intervening
sometimes, he prepared cheerful and unexpected
comedy, where otherwise there would have been
the deepest tragedy.</p>

<p>This might have been merely scientific curiosity&mdash;we
will not discuss that point&mdash;but thanks to this keen
interest, if a patient were very ill, and that happened
frequently, he would remain to watch by the bedside,
and again,&mdash;and this happened yet more frequently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
for Doctor Santos devoted himself almost exclusively
to poor people&mdash;there would not be money
enough to buy supper for the family or broth or medicine
for the sick one; then our doctor would pull out
his purse and send for whatever was necessary. His
patients never lacked for what was needed to restore
them to health.</p>

<p>The doctor’s greatest pleasure, as he always declared,
was to cure sick children. It seemed impossible
that a man who had no family and who, according
to all accounts, had never married, and who had been
adopted himself by a barber who took him from an
orphan asylum, should be able to feel such absolute
tenderness of heart towards little ones.</p>

<p>A woman, whose son the doctor had restored to
health, aptly expressed the sentiments of every one:
“It seems as if Doctor Santos had been a mother
himself.”</p>

<p>We will take it for granted that his life and good
deeds are well known, for many a scientific work can
testify to the merits of Doctor Santos; so we will not
stop to give a detailed resumé or minute account of
the arduous labor of many years spent in true performance
of his profession.</p>

<p>I am now going to speak of an event in his life
which, if it were not absolutely true, would seem to
many people to be altogether improbable.</p>

<p>Doctor Santos always said that the elixir of long
life was a very easy and simple thing to obtain, that
it was not necessary to knock one’s head against the
wall in order that the electric spark of an idea should
spring out of the brain, and that even the most stupid
could give a solution of the problem to those who discussed
it learnedly, but that not even this elixir nor
any other could be applied in every case, that it was
just as difficult to unite a head to the body from which
it had been severed as to repair the ravages of some illnesses.
In eighty cases out of a hundred, however, he
was sure that the elixir would give good results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The strangest thing was that these were not merely
affirmations, but positive proofs, for in his practice he
had tried the remedy and, not only eighty to a hundred,
but in even greater proportion, had produced
good results. He never could be made to specify the
remedy, and he put an end to all questions on the subject,
by saying:</p>

<p>“Nothing, nothing, it is like, it is like Columbus’s
egg, why prove it?”</p>

<p>It was long after twelve o’clock one night, when
Doctor Santos entered a miserable garret in the <i>Salle
de Fuencarral</i>. The door was partly open. A middle-aged
man was stretched out on a rude cot. The
rest of the furniture consisted of some broken, rush-bottomed
chairs, and a pine table by the bedside.
The sick man had no relatives in Madrid; he had arrived
from Cataluña a little more than a month before
and had fallen ill with pneumonia. He refused, absolutely,
to go to the hospital, so a charitable neighbor,
who had attended to his simple wants for some time,
called in Doctor Santos. The disease had already
made inroads upon the man’s constitution. Although
the pneumonia was helped, the doctor could not cure
the quick consumption which followed and which
would soon end the man’s life.</p>

<p>When the sick man saw the doctor enter, an expression
of joy passed over his features, as if now black
death had no terror for him; for, in the last sad moments,
a warm hand would clasp his and a loving heart
would be moved to sympathy. The doctor took the
sick man’s hand.</p>

<p>“How are you, Jaime?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I am dying, I feel sure of it, but I wish to ask one
more favor of you who have already done so many for
me. Tell me how much longer I have to live. I know
there is nothing that will help me, and I am almost
glad that it is so, for I have suffered so much in my
life. At least, I shall cease to suffer. It is true, is it
not, that over there there is no more pain, all is quiet,
dark, cold?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Accustomed as Doctor Santos was to such scenes, he
could scarcely keep back the tears&mdash;much to his own
disgust, when he looked at the poor fellow&mdash;and he
growled to himself: “A weeping doctor is a fool.”
But he answered the dying man very gently:</p>

<p>“What can I do for you, Jaime? To whom shall I
write? Let me know just what you wish to be done
and I promise you to do it as far as I am able, and
before it slips my memory. I don’t want to frighten
you, but every one takes things differently. Judging
from the state you are in, I am not the one just now to
do you the most good, and we must soon send for one
who can give you the only true consolation. After all,
although this life means a great deal to us, we ought
to be glad rather than sorry at the thought of leaving
it, because we are all sure that God is good and will
pardon us, and that he loves us. For this reason we
call him Father, for if he is not better than the best
on earth, what other conception can we have of him?</p>

<p>“Now, I will go myself to call a priest whom I know,
and in the meantime, I will see if a neighbor will stay
with you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t go, I beg of you. I must talk to you.”</p>

<p>The doctor dared not say no, but he knew that the
hour of death was swiftly approaching. A moment
later he left the room, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I’ll return directly.”</p>

<p>He sent a neighbor for the priest, then returned as
he had promised, and sat down by the head of the bed.</p>

<p>Jaime asked the doctor to do him the favor to put
his hand under the mattress and take out a packet
which he would find there. After the doctor had
pulled out the packet, Jaime began to speak:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Doctor, I ask you not to open this packet until
after I am dead, and after that, with the help of your
own conscience, you will decide what you think had
best be done. I want you, if any personal advantage
can come to you from it, to use it all for yourself. I
have no affection for any one else, nor am I in debt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
any one. If this were not my last hour on earth I
should say that my soul held nothing but hatred for
the evil received from those I most cherished.”</p>

<p>The sick man seemed fatigued and the doctor told
him to rest a few moments, but now the man began to
make those motions of the hands, so characteristic of
those about to die, and to plait and unplait the bed
clothing. He did not seem to know exactly what he
was saying and his eyes wandered restlessly about the
room:&mdash;</p>

<p>“She deceived me. How much I loved her! Her
beautiful black eyes! How pretty she was! And he
my best friend! It was infamous, shameful! I saw
them! the truth is proof enough! Ah, how much
blood flowed from the wound!&mdash;he did not mind dying
because he knew she loved him. And I envied him
after he was dead! Ah, how hard the punishment!
How dark the cell, how heavy the shackles! It is
shameful! I am an assassin! Every one has left me!
How blue the sky is! How fresh and green the fields!
I can’t get out with these horrible irons on my
wrists!”</p>

<p>The priest came in time to administer the extreme
unction. Jaime died shortly after and the doctor returned
home with the packet under his arm. Once
in his study, before going to bed, he decided to open
the bundle which Jaime had give him with so much
mystery. It was an easy task. He untied the paper
and out fell what seemed to be a magazine. There
were hundreds of leaves, but each leaf was a banknote
of four thousand reals.</p>

<p>Daylight glimmered through the curtains. Doctor
Santos had not closed his eyes. He was the owner, the
rightful owner of more than four thousand pésétas
(one hundred thousand dollars) and the donation was
absolutely legitimate. Jaime’s mind, as no one knew
better than he, was perfectly clear at the time he made
the gift. What should he do with all that money!
He would be happy, all his friends would be happy, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
fact, everyone would be happy! What a library, what
a laboratory, he would have!</p>

<p>Hours passed, but the doctor tossed and turned
restlessly on his bed, unable to sleep for a moment.
The clock struck seven. He could not stay in bed any
longer; he arose, made his accustomed hasty toilet,
drank his coffee and started off on his usual round of
visits. He began with the very sick patients, but at
ten o’clock he said to himself, he would get a friend
to accompany him to the bank that he might deposit
the money. He had never kept any money in a bank.
The little box in his office had always held all he could
spare, and he did not know exactly what legal forms
were necessary in order to have it placed so that he
could draw out certain sums when he wished.</p>

<p>His first patient lived several miles away, so he carried
the precious package with him in order not to
lose time in going and coming. He stopped at the
patient’s house. The sick man was a cabinet maker
who had been trying to work with an injured hand,
consequently, blood poisoning had set in and the symptoms
were such that amputation seemed necessary.
The poor man, strong as an oak, cried like a child.</p>

<p>“The maintenance of my wife and family lies in the
skill of my five fingers,” he said, “and now you are
going to cut them off.”</p>

<p>But Doctor Santos, more of an optimist than ever
that day, brought the bright light of hope into the sad
hearts of the afflicted family. They might rely upon
him for support and help as long as they needed it.</p>

<p>He then went to see a talented journalist who had
not prospered since he began to have ideas and tastes
of his own instead of praising those of other people.
The journalist had lost his place because he had published,
without first consulting the director, an article
in which he said that what Marruecos most needed was
some powerful nation to civilize it, that our position
in the matter was like that of the gardener’s dog, keeping
others from doing what we could not do ourselves;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
that it would be better to be annexed to a rich country
than a poor one, to have a cultivated country instead
of a semi-savage one; and a hundred other barbarities
besides.</p>

<p>As one might well imagine, the journalist had trouble
with his head, he was worn out by fatigue and had
the beginning of softening of the brain. Doctor Santos
had ordered rest, a quiet, regular life, early hours,
and horseback riding.</p>

<p>The journalist sent out to a store for a pasteboard
horse, and when the doctor called to see him, the sick
man said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“This is the only horse I can afford.”</p>

<p>Of course, he plainly showed his insanity by this
act, but Doctor Santos did not look upon it in that
light. He begged the man’s pardon for having advised
him to buy what he could not afford.</p>

<p>A little later, he visited a widow with three children.
She was young and pretty; her husband had been a
sculptor of some talent. He was not rich, but he had
earned enough to support his family decently. He
died and for the first year the wife managed to live
fairly well, by dint of great economy. The second
year, the widow sold her husband’s art treasures; the
third year, she lived on the gifts of relatives and
friends, which gave out before the fourth year, and
the family went from the second floor to the garret,
from wholesome food to scanty scraps, from warm
clothing to rags. Last of all came sickness.</p>

<p>Doctor Santos felt inspired: “If this little woman
goes to the bad, whose fault will it be? Her sewing
brings in so little!” Pulling out a banknote, he handed
it to the widow, telling her to live where she could
have fresh air and sunlight, to buy nourishing food
and look after the little ones.</p>

<p>The doctor left that poverty-stricken place, his plain
face so radiant with happiness that it seemed almost
beautiful. He thought to himself, as he went along,
that if Jaime had used some of this money for himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and had lived properly, he would not have died of consumption.
“That devilish avarice!” he muttered.
“A millionaire living and dying like a beggar in order
not to spend his money. What is the good of money
if it is not to spend?”</p>

<p>Suddenly two ideas flashed into his head. “Suppose
this is stolen money! What if the bills are
false?”</p>

<p>He stopped. The package fell from his hand.</p>

<p>“Sir, you have dropped something,” said a poor
woman who was passing. The doctor picked up the
bundle and, turning around, went home.</p>

<p>“Stolen or false,” he muttered grimly. “There is
no other solution.”</p>

<p>The words and the ideas sounded in his ears, they
hurt him, as if some one had struck him on the head
with a hammer.</p>

<p>He reached his home, told his old servant that he
would see no one, then changed his mind, sent the
woman off on an errand, and shut himself up in his
office.</p>

<p>The doctor had in his house two banknotes of a
thousand pésétas (two hundred and fifty dollars) each.</p>

<p>“We will begin with the hypothesis that I can prove
them false,” he said. He took out his own banknotes
and laid them on the table; took another out of the
package and placed it between the first two.</p>

<p>“They must have been stolen,” he said, “for all
three are alike, the same block, the same print.”</p>

<p>He turned them over, they were exactly alike. Well,
there was nothing to be done but to advertise and
await the rightful owner, and he would have to word
the advertisement so that every Spaniard in the country
should not appear to claim the money.</p>

<p>He took a magnifying glass and began to make
methodical observations. First, the paper, its quality,
its transparency; then the engravings; the letters, letter
by letter, the signatures. But even with the help
of the glass, which magnified the size six or eight
times, he could detect no difference between the bills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“From whom could Jaime have stolen them? Had
blood been shed on account of those bits of paper?
Had Jaime robbed the government or a bank?”</p>

<p>The doctor thought and thought. He studied, with
the aid of a glass, every detail, even the smallest.</p>

<p>“Is it possible,” he exclaimed, “that each one can
be so perfect? They have been stolen, undoubtedly
stolen,” he said, at the end of a quarter of an hour of
close observation. Ten times, already, he had compared
the numeration, but he turned again to look
at it.</p>

<p>“They all look alike,” he said again, but when he
took away the crystal he doubted the certainty of his
own vision. He brought out a delicate compass and
measured the numbers of his old bills. He placed the
compass on the new, there was absolutely no difference.</p>

<p>He was not satisfied with the length alone, but he
even measured the width of the lines.</p>

<p>“They have been stolen,” he repeated mechanically.
Then, as if answering himself, he spoke slowly:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Where could he have stolen them? No, they are
counterfeit, false, false. Ah, thou Catalan rogue,
who art in the infernal regions. I hope that thou art
making false notes with thy skin of Barrabas!”</p>

<p>“I have learned the secret,” thought the doctor.
“There is no doubt of it.”</p>

<p>He still looked exclusively at the numbers, the false
ones looked larger, they really were not, but as
the lines were more delicate, it made the ciphers look
larger.</p>

<p>“Those poor people are now in prison,” said Doctor
Santos sorrowfully. “They have denounced me and
the police will shortly come to arrest me, and no one
will believe they were ever given to me!”</p>

<p>He raised the stove cover. “No, that won’t do. The
embers and ashes will remain. They can smell the
smoke and burnt paper.”</p>

<p>The doctor had a dove-cot: a dove just then lighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
on the window sill. A bright idea came to him. He
took two tin boxes&mdash;such as are used for cut tobacco&mdash;and
stuffed them both full with bank notes, climbed
up to the dove-cot and looked through the garret window.
No one could see him. He raised some tiles and
hid the boxes, then covered them up, leaving all as it
was before. Breathing heavily, his heart thumping furiously,
he descended the staircase which led to the second
floor and dropping into a chair, opened a huge
volume which he held before his face, while he tried
to recover his usual composure.</p>

<p>If he had been surprised and arrested, the inspector
would have noticed that the book was upside down,
the two old bills, with the magnifying glass and compass,
were still on the table, and that the lappels and
sleeves of his coat were covered with earth and whitewash.</p>

<p>After several hours had passed, the old servant had
returned, and as no one else had appeared, the doctor
began to think that perhaps the bills had not yet been
changed and, by virtue of such a supposition, he hurried
to the widow’s house with the pious intention of
substituting one of his old bank notes in place of the
supposed false one. The bill had been changed; the
widow and her children were having a little party in
honor of their great good luck. They were not alone,
as they generally were, but had asked several of their
friends to share their joy. They were so profuse in
their expressions of gratitude that the good old doctor
did not know what to say nor how to explain his sudden
return.</p>

<p>“Now be sure you take a room where you can have
sunlight and give the children a dose of castor oil,” he
said as he hurried away.</p>

<p>Doctor Santos did not recover his usual composure
for a long time. He seemed taciturn although he continued
in his accustomed mode of living. After a
while, however, he became more like himself.</p>

<p>The cabinet maker, for whom the doctor had obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
a lucrative position, wished to make a public
manifestation of his gratitude, but the doctor forbade
him to even mention that he had received help. Nevertheless,
it was murmured continually, that Doctor
Santos, on account of his relations with persons of high
rank, had given many a one a modest pension, while
he had restored others to health by giving to them the
money to procure a change of climate and a much
needed rest.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his friends of high rank, the doctor
still lived in his modest apartment and had moreover,
dismissed his only servant. He now took his meals at
a neighboring tavern. He still kept the dove-cot, and
he had bought an expensive therapeutical apparatus
and costly instruments. He had a laboratory and a
fine medical library.</p>

<p>He earned enough and he had innumerable friends
who gave him money to help cases of true necessity,
owing to his fame of discerning where help was really
needed. Happily society is not so completely decayed
that it does not produce, with frequent spontaneity,
the flower of Christian charity.</p>

<p>When Doctor Santos changed his habits of living,
his character also changed. Formerly, he had been
cheerful and lively, fond of an occasional visit to the
theatre, and especially fond of a good table. But
when he might have had all this he became gloomy
and moody, and reduced his personal expenses, in
spite of his large earnings, to an extent almost miserly.</p>

<p>The years rolled by, the doctor’s hair was snowy
white, and he scarcely spoke. As he was no longer
young and paid so little attention to his own comfort,
his health began to fail. The cold was intense that
winter and Doctor Santos, in spite of himself, had to
keep his bed many a day.</p>

<p>His medical confrères visited him, and one, in particular,
earnestly urged him to go to a warm climate.</p>

<p>“Must I go away, leave my work and occupations
to die, not of sickness, but of ennui?” “But,” argued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
his friend, “no one likes better than you to send
people off for a change of air during the winter.”</p>

<p>The doctor did not reply, but he remained in Madrid,
passing sleepless nights and coughing ceaselessly.</p>

<p>His friends, the only family he possessed, took
turns, for a long time in caring for him, but, as the
days lengthened into weeks, the weeks into months
and each one gradually began to find that his own
cares absorbed his time, it was agreed upon that the
best thing to do was to have a sister of charity come
and nurse the doctor.</p>

<p>Henceforth, his friends’ visits grew less frequent,
and there were days at a time when his door bell did
not ring once.</p>

<p>Sor Luz, as the sister of charity was called, proved
to be a perfect substitute for all his other attendants.
Although the doctor had never cared for women’s
society, he found Sor Luz such a charming companion
that he refused to receive other people, if it were possible.</p>

<p>Her white head-dress and the undulations of her
soft gown, seemed to him like the motions of a dove’s
wings.</p>

<p>Doctor Santos followed her with an affectionate and
grateful glance, thus repaying the tender and solicitous
care which only maternal and Christian love
could give with such absolute abnegation and perseverance.</p>

<p>About the last of November, that harvest time of
death, when a few golden leaves still clung to the trees,
when the mountain tops were covered with silver and
the cold, northerly wind penetrated the crevices of
doors and windows, Doctor Santos began to grow
worse.</p>

<p>He declared in his will, dated years before, that he
had no property and that whatever was found in the
house belonged, by right, to the poor. That he wished
to have a humble funeral and be buried in the public
cemetery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>In looking over his papers and effects, a tin box was
found containing forty banknotes of one thousand
pésétas each.</p>

<p>His friends declared that he had died of avarice.
Sor Luz said that she had never known any one who
had passed away with more tranquil, resigned Christian
spirit than Doctor Santos.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she often spoke of some phrases of
the doctor’s which were utterly incomprehensible to
her and for which she could not account.</p>

<p>“When there was yet time,” he said, “I had the
means to cure myself. It would have been so easy,
that if it had been any one else I should have done
so. I did not do it because I wished to preserve my
own self-respect and to have some merit when God
called me to a better life.”</p>

<h2 class="p2">THE CURING OF KATE NEGLEY.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dci.jpg" width="100" height="118" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi120">“I TOLD you once,” said Mrs. Melissa Allgood,
“about the time Kate Negley took that leading
on the lodge line, and locked the doctor out of
the house one night when he was meeting with the
Masons, and hollered at him scornful-like, when he
come home, to ‘get in with his lodge-key;’ and how
the doctor smashed up her fine front door with an ax.
Well, all the Station thought that might be the end
of Kate’s foolishness, and that maybe she would take
her religion and sanctification comfortable after that,
same as other folks. And everybody was glad Dr.
Negley broke that door in, because it ain’t good for
Kate Negley or any other human to have their own
way all the time.</p>

<p>“So Kate went along quiet and peaceable after that
for two or three months, and never had no new leadings
to tell about in meeting, and never did a thing
to show she had heartfelt religion except to wear her
hair straight down her back, according to Paul. And
ma she said to me one day she believed Kate had come
to the end of her line, and was going to act like sensible
folks the rest of her days. But I told ma not
to waste her breath in vain babblings; that I bet Kate
Negley was just setting on a new nest, and for ma
to wait for the hatching.</p>

<p>“I hadn’t hardly spoke the words before it come.
The very next Sunday, when Brother Cheatham got
through preaching and called for experiences and testimonies,
Kate she rose and said she was mightily
moved to rebuke a faithless and perverse generation,
puffed up in its fleshly mind, loving unrighteousness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and abominable in wickedness. She said she had been
wandering in the way of destruction like the rest, and
putting her faith in lies, till the last few weeks, when
light begun to dawn on her, and she commenced to
search the Scriptures more. She said she was fully
persuaded now, halleluiah! and wanted all them that
desired to be wholly sanctified to enter the strait
and narrow path with her. She said the gospel she
had to preach to them that morning was the gospel
of healing by prayer and faith, and not by medicines
or doctors; that though she had lain among the pots,
like the rest of them, yet now was her soul like the
wings of a dove, and forever risen above all such
works of the devil as ipecac and quinine and calomel;
that only in the Great Physician did she place her
trust; that as for earthly doctors, she could only say
to them, in the words of Job: ‘Ye are forgers of lies,
ye are all physicians of no value.’ She said yea, verily,
all they was good for was to ‘beguile unstable
souls, and bewitch the people with sorceries;’ and not
only that, but, like Jeremiah says, ‘They help forward
the affliction.’ She said she never meant to say
anything against doctors as <i>men</i>, but as <i>doctors</i> they
was vessels of wrath, corrupters of souls, firebrands
of the devil, and the liveliest stumble-stones in the
path of righteousness. She said for them benighted
folks that put their faith in physic to listen to Jeremiah’s
point-blank words, ‘Thou hast <i>no</i> healing medicines,’
and again, ‘In vain shalt thou use many medicines;
for thou shalt not be healed.’ She said from lid
to lid of the Bible there wasn’t a single case of anybody
being cured of anything by either doctors or
medicine; and that ought to be enough for the earnest
Christian, without looking any farther. But, she said,
knowing their hard-heartedness, she had studied every
verse of the Scriptures before she got up to speak.</p>

<p>“She said when the disciples was sent out, they was
told to preach the gospel, heal the sick, cleanse the
lepers, and cast out devils; and they did it. She said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
she’d like to know how many that called themselves
disciples nowadays so bigotty, and claimed the in-dwelling
of holiness, ever even tried to do any of them
things, except talk, let alone do them. She said it was
because they were so poor-spirited they didn’t have
faith to lay hold of the promise, though there it was
in plain words: ‘Ask, and ye shall receive;’ ‘According
to your faith be it unto you;’ ‘For I will restore
health to thee, saith the Lord;’ ‘I kill, and I make
alive; I wound, and I heal.’ She said, bless the Lord,
her spiritual eyes was open now, and the only medicines
she would ever take was prayer and faith. She
said James’s prescription was good enough for her:
‘Pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The
effectual fervent prayer of the righteous availeth
much;’ and that she wanted every soul in the Station
to get to the same point. But, she said, until they
did, she wanted it known that there was one righteous
soul in Sodom, that was going to start out on the war-path
against the devil and all his doctors. She said
she was going to lay hold of the promise of James:
‘Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders
of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing
him with oil; and the prayer of faith shall save the
sick, and the Lord shall raise him up.’ She said she
wanted it published abroad that anybody that took
sick was welcome to her services and prayers, without
money and without price. She said for all her hearers
to put on the breastplate of faith and the armor
of righteousness, and enter in at the strait and narrow
path that opened into her front door, and keep
out of the broad way that led to the doctor’s office.
She said she had a big bottle of sweet-oil, and faith
to remove mountains.</p>

<p>“Well, all the congregation was thunderstruck at
the idea of Kate Negley setting up in opposition to
her own husband, Dr. Negley being the only doctor
at the Station. Ma said that anybody could have
knocked her down with a feather; and I know it made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
me right weak in my knees, though, of course, I felt
like Kate was doing right to follow her leadings, and
thought she was mighty courageous. I never could have
done it myself, especially if I’d had such a good husband
as Kate. I have traveled about more than Kate,
and I know that hen’s teeth ain’t scarcer than good
men; yea, like Solomon says, ‘One among a thousand
have I found.’ But of course a woman never appreciates
what she has, and Kate she always took all the
doctor’s kindness and spoiling like it was her birthright,
and ding-donged at him all the time about his
not having any religion or sanctification. Now, I
reckon you’ve lived long enough to know that there are
three kinds of sanctified; them that are sanctified and
know it, humble-like&mdash;such as me; them that are sanctified
and don’t know or even suspicion it; and them
that are sanctified and know it too well. And I have
told ma many a time that Dr. Negley is one of the
kind that is sanctified and don’t know it, and that
Kate might pattern after the doctor in <i>some</i> ways, to
her edification. Somehow, I’ve always felt like ten
or eleven children might have took some of the foolishness
out of Kate; but, not having any, she was just
on a high horse about something or other all the time.</p>

<p>“The evening after Kate did that talking in
church, ma saw the doctor riding by, and she called
him to the fence and asked him if he had heard about
Kate’s talk, and what he thought about it. And he
said yes, Brother Jones and them had told him about
it down at the post-office, and it had tickled him
might’ly; that he thought it was very funny. Ma
told him she should think it would make him mad for
Kate to get up and talk that away about doctors and
medicine. ‘Mrs. Garry,’ he says, ‘women are women;
and one of their charms is that nobody knows what
they’re going to do next. And if my wife,’ he says,
‘has a extry allowance of charm, I certainly ought to
feel thankful for it.’ He said if Kate wanted to quarrel
with her bread and butter, and talk away his practice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
he wasn’t going to raise any objections; that he
needed to take a rest anyhow, having worked too hard
all his life. He said, another thing, a woman that took
as many notions as Kate couldn’t hold on to any one of
them very long, but was bound to get cured of it before
much harm was done.</p>

<p>“Ma she told me what he said, and that, in her opinion,
Dr. Negley could give Job lessons in patience.</p>

<p>“Then we commenced to have times in the Station.
The first thing Kate did was to get up one night after
the doctor had gone to sleep, and go down-stairs and
across the yard to his office, and hunt up his saddle-bags,
and stamp on them, and smash every bottle in
them, and then sling them over in pa’s cornfield. Pa
he found them out there in the morning after breakfast,
and took them to the doctor’s office; and he said
the doctor did some tall swearing when he saw them.
But I believe that was a slander of pa’s, because I
know the way the doctor acted afterwards. At dinner-time
he went up to the house mighty peaceful, and eat
his dinner, and then he says to Kate, very cheerful
and polite: ‘I see that my saddle-bags have met with
a little accident. It’s an ill wind that blows nobody
good,’ he says, ‘and I don’t know but what it’s a fine
thing for my patients, some of them medicines being
powerful stale. But it’s mighty unfortunate for you,
Kate,’ he says, ‘for I will be obliged to use up all your
missionary money for the next year and a half to replenish
them saddle-bags, times being so hard,’ he
says.</p>

<p>“You know Kate always give more money to missions
than any woman in the Station,&mdash;doctor just
couldn’t deny her anything,&mdash;and she prided herself
a heap on it, righteous pride, of course. She was just
speechless with wrath at what he said, and she saw
she’d have to change her warfare and fall back on the
outposts.</p>

<p>“So she started out and went to see the women in
the Station, and prayed with them, and strengthened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
their faith, and tried to make them promise to send for
her if anybody got sick, and not for the doctor, and
worked on them till they got plumb unsettled in their
minds. Some of them went to Brother Cheatham and
asked him about it, and he said it was a question everybody
must decide for themselves, but there certainly
was Scripture for it, he couldn’t deny. It’s a funny
thing what poor hands some preachers are at practicing.
Brother Cheatham couldn’t get so much as a
crook in his little finger but what Dr. Negley must
come, double-quick, day and night. I’ve always felt
like getting their doctoring for nothing was a big
drawback to preachers’ faith.</p>

<p>“Kate didn’t only go about in the Station, but she
would keep on the watch, and when the doctor got a
call to the country, Kate would saddle her bay mare
and follow after him, sometimes ten or fifteen miles.
By the time she would get to the sick one’s house, the
doctor would be setting by the bed, feeling the patient’s
pulse, or some such; and Kate would sail across
the room, with never so much as ‘Howdy’ to the doctor,
and go down on her knees the other side of the
bed, and dab a little sweet-oil on the sick person, and
pray at the top of her voice, and exhort the patient
to throw away the vile concoctions of the devil, and
swing out on the promise of James. And the doctor
wouldn’t pay no more attention to her than she did to
him, but would dose out the medicine and go on about
his business, as pleasant as could be. After he was
gone, Kate would smash up all the bottles in sight, if
the folks wasn’t mighty careful; and then she would
follow the doctor to the next place, never any more
noticing him or speaking to him than if he was a
fence-post. She said when the doctor was at home,
he was her husband, though unregenerate, and she
was going to treat him according to Scripture, and as
polite as she knew how: but when he was out dosing
the sick, he was an angel of darkness, and not fit to be
so much as looked at by the saved and sanctified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mary Alice Welden was one of the first to take up
with Kate’s notions&mdash;I’ve always believed it was because
Dick Welden scoffed at them. If Dick had been
a quick man, he never would have done it, knowing
well that the only way to get Mary Alice to do like he
wanted her to was for him to come out strong on the
opposite side. But it takes a hundred years to learn
some men anything; and what did Dick do that Sunday
but laugh at Kate’s notions on healing. Ever
since Mary Alice had shook the red rag at Satan by
getting up and shouting in church one time when Dick
had told her point-blank she shouldn’t, she had enjoyed
a heap of liberty, and Dick he had been diminished,
like the Bible says. So when Dick laughed at
Kate, Mary Alice fired right up and told Dick Welden
that never another doctor or bottle of medicine should
ever step over her door-sill, and that the next time any
of her household got sick, prayer or nothing should
cure them.</p>

<p>“So the next time her little Philury had spasms,
Mary Alice sent over for Kate; and when Dick come
home for dinner, he found all the doors locked, and
looked in at a window, and there was Philury in fits
on the bed, and Kate and Mary Alice praying loud
and long on both sides. Dick was just crazy, and he
ran up the street for the doctor, and they come back
and broke in the window, and there was Philury laying
quiet and peaceful and breathing regular, and
Kate and Mary Alice shouting and glorifying God
for casting a devil out of Philury. That gave Kate a
big reputation, and stirred the Station to the dregs.
And even the doctor said it was only by the grace of
God that Philury pulled through under the circumstances.</p>

<p>“Sister Sally Barnes had been laying up for nearly
a year with a misery in her back, and the doctor had
give her physic, and she had took up all the patent
medicines she could borrow or raise money to buy, but
there she laid, and expected to lay the rest of her days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Kate went up there one day and expounded Bible to
her and anointed her with that oil, and prayed over
her for about two hours, and then told her to rise and
cook dinner, that the Lord had healed her. And up
Sister Sally got, and has been up ever since. Of course
everybody was excited and talking about it. Ma asked
Dr. Negley one day what he thought about it, and he
said it was a mighty fine thing for Sister Sally’s family,
and that Kate’s medicine was certainly better for
<i>some</i> folks than his.</p>

<p>“That healing gave Kate a big name, and folks begun
to send for her right and left. Some would send
for her and the doctor both, thinking it just as well
to be on the safe side and not neglect either faith or
works. I reckon it did the sick good just to lay eyes
on Kate, she was such a fine, healthy, rosy-checked
woman, and never had had a day’s sickness to pull
her down.</p>

<p>“Then come along the time for Sister Nickins’
shingles. For seven years old Sister Nickins, Tommy
T.’s ma, had took down regular, every Washington’s
Birthday, at ten o’clock in the morning, with the
shingles. Everybody thought a duck could as soon
get along without water as Sister Nickins without her
shingles; and she never dreamt of such a thing as not
having them. They never got to the breaking-out
stage with her but once, but she was scared to death
every time for fear they would break out, and run all
around her and meet, and of course that will kill anybody
dead. So she used to make her will and give
away her gray mule every year, beforehand.</p>

<p>“This time Kate sent Sister Nickins word not to
make no will or give away the mule; that she was going
to cast them shingles into the bottomless pit by
prayer. So, at sun-up on the 22d, Kate went up to
Sister Nickins’s house, and set into praying and
anointing, and by ten o’clock she had Sister Nickins
so full of grace and glory that the devil or the shingles
couldn’t get within a mile of her, and she never felt a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
single pain. And of all the halleluiah times, that was
one. You could hear the shouting all over town, and
nearly all the Station went up there. I went myself,
and saw Sister Nickins with my own eyes, up and
about, and full of rejoicings, and not a shingle to her
name. I thought it was wonderful. It seemed just
like Bible times over again. And Sister Nickins was
so lifted up over it that she mounted her gray mule
after dinner and started out on a three months’ visitation
through the county, to spread the news abroad
amongst her kin and friends.</p>

<p>“That was the winter I felt the inward call to
preach, but never got no outward invitations. So,
while I was having that trial of patience, I thought
I might as well help Kate some, though I knew my call
was to preach, and not to heal. And I would go around
a good deal with Kate, though I never was just as rampant
as she was, or as Mary Alice Welden, and always
allowed that doctors <i>might</i> have their uses.</p>

<p>“One day Kate came by for me to go up with her
to pray over old Mis’ Gerton’s rheumatism. So up
we went, and Kate told old Mis’ Gerton what we come
for, and Mis’ Gerton said she never had no objections,
that prayer certainly couldn’t do no harm, and oil
was good for the joints. So I poured on the oil, and
Kate did the praying. In about an hour Kate jumped
up and told old Mis’ Gerton to get up and walk, that
the prayer of faith had healed her. ‘No such a thing,’
old Mis’ Gerton says; ‘them knees is worse than when
you commenced.’ Kate got red in the face, and said of
course the grace was thrown away on them that
wouldn’t accept of it. Old Mis’ Gerton said she
couldn’t tell no lies; that she felt worse instead of better;
that pain was pain, and rheumatism was rheumatism,
as well they knew that had it. She said she never
meant no disrespect, but that in her opinion prayer
couldn’t hold a candle to Dr. Hayhurst’s Wildcat Liniment
as a pain-killer. Of course Kate was horror-struck,
and she wiped the dust of old Mis’ Gerton’s
house off of her feet when we went out.</p>

<p>“Then what should pa do about that time but take
down with the yellow janders. You know, and everybody
knows, that pa never did have a bit of religion.
I would hate to say such a thing about an own relation,
but pa being my stepfather, and the second one
at that, I feel like he’s kind of far-removed. Well, ma
would have been a mighty religious woman if she
hadn’t been unequally yoked together with unbelievers
three times. That’s enough to wear a woman’s
religion to a frazzle, goodness knows; and I have always
made excuses for ma. So when pa got sick and
told ma to send for the doctor, ma, being one of those
women that is always trying to serve two masters, her
husband and her religion, sent for the doctor and Kate
both. And when I got there, a few minutes later,
there set the doctor by pa’s bed, and Kate and ma back
in the kitchen, and every time Kate would start over
the door-sill into pa’s room, to pour the oil on him
and pray over him, pa would set up in bed and shake
his fist at her, and swear a blue streak, and tell her not
to come another step. Ma and me we nearly went
through the earth for shame at pa; and of course he
never would have done it if his liver had been right,
for I will say this for pa, he is a polite, mild-mannered
man, and slow to wrath, when he hasn’t got the janders.
Then Kate would flop down on the kitchen floor
and thank the Lord she was being persecuted for
righteousness’ sake. And a good many people dropped
in, hearing the noise; and everybody was plumb scandalized
at pa, and said he was a downright infidel, and
all their sympathies was roused for Kate.</p>

<p>“After that she had a bigger business than ever, in
spite of a set-back or two, like old Mis’ Gerton’s rheumatism,
and Brother Gilly Jones’s baby dying one
night of the croup when him and Kate was praying
over it and wouldn’t send for the doctor. Kate said
that it was the Lord’s will, and the baby’s appointed
time to die; and Brother Gilly Jones, being sanctified,
and having eight more children anyhow, he agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
with Kate, and said he felt perfectly resigned; though
Sister Jones, poor thing, never has got reconciled to
this day.</p>

<p>“Of course those things never fazed Kate, and she
was just on the top notch all the time, and going day
and night. And every Sunday there would be testimonials
in church about healings, and faith begun to
take hold on both sanctified and sinner, till it actually
got to the point that folks’ religion was doubted if they
sent for a doctor. And when spring opened up, the
doctor said his occupation was so near gone that he felt
justified in going on that camp-hunt he had been wanting
to make for fourteen years; so he made up a party
of men&mdash;Masons and such&mdash;and went down on Green
River for two weeks’ hunting.</p>

<p>“Well, you ought to have seen Kate that morning
the doctor left. He wasn’t out of sight before she
turned loose a-shouting over the triumph of righteousness,
and over having actually run the devil out of
town; and she held a thanks-meeting up at her house
that night, and we had a full-salvation time.</p>

<p>“Kate invited me to stay with her while the doctor
was gone; so I shooed my chickens down to ma’s, so’s
I could have my mind free from worldly cares, and
shut up my house, and went. We had a mighty joyful,
edifying time for two days.</p>

<p>“The third night Kate woke me up sudden from
a good sleep, about three o’clock in the morning.
‘Melissy,’ she says, ‘get up and light the lamp. I don’t
know what on earth’s the matter with me,’ she says;
‘I feel awful, and have got all the aches there is inside
of me.’ ‘For goodness’ sake, Kate,’ I says, rolling
out of bed, ‘I reckon you are getting the grippe.’ She
groaned. ‘It’s worse than the grippe, Melissy Allgood,’
she says; ‘I feel like I’m going to die.’ I lit
the lamp and brought it over by the bed. ‘I do believe
you have got some fever, Kate,’ I says. ‘I am
eat up with it,’ she says, ‘and with aches, and have
a terrible gone feeling all over. I tell you, Melissy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
I’m an awful sick woman. Oh, what shall I do&mdash;what
shall I do?’ ‘Do?’ I says, no little surprised. ‘Why,
<i>pray</i>, of course.’ ‘Well,’ she says, kind of faint-like,
‘you’d better be about it.’</p>

<p>“I was a little outdone by her lukewarmness, but I
got down on my knees and went to praying. Kate kept
up a consid’able groaning. In about five minutes she
says: ‘Get up from there, Melissy Allgood, and do
something for me. I’m a terrible sick woman,’ she
says. ‘Gracious sakes alive, Kate,’ I says, ‘there ain’t
another thing I <i>can</i> do but anoint you with the oil.’
I run and brought the sweet-oil. ‘Take it away!’ she
says. ‘The smell of it makes me sick! I won’t have
it!’ I was completely dazed, and it seemed to me like
the world was turning upside down. But what can
you expect of a woman that don’t know what the feeling
of pain is, and never had a sick day since she was
a young child and got through the catching age? I
fell down on my knees and went to praying again, not
knowing just what to do. Kate stopped me again.
‘Melissy Allgood,’ she says, ‘are you going to let me
lay here and <i>die</i>, and not stretch out even a finger to
help me?’ she says. ‘Why, Kate,’ I says, plumb petrified,
‘you know I’m doing the very best that can be
done.’ I says: ‘You must have patience and faith,
and wait on the time of the Lord.’ ‘Oh!’ she says,
fairly crying, ‘what on earth made the doctor go off
and leave me? He might have known something would
happen to me. He ought to have stayed here, where
he belongs! <i>He’d</i> know what to do for me if <i>he</i> was
here,’ she says. ‘He wouldn’t let his own dear wife
lay here and die!’</p>

<p>“’Kate,’ I says, ‘you are wandering, the worst kind.
I’m going after Mary Alice Welden.’ So I slipped
on my shoes and dress and run down the street to
Mary Alice’s, and we hurried back as fast as we could.
I told Mary Alice that Kate was sick, and out of her
mind to that extent she was calling for the doctor.
Mary Alice said she certainly must be mighty bad off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and that we must pray with abounding faith, and be
firm. When we got back, Kate was still a-groaning
and crying. Mary Alice told her to cease her complainings
and put her trust in One who was mighty
to save. Then Mary Alice snatched up the bottle of
sweet-oil that set there on the table, and started at
Kate with it. ‘She won’t have it on her,’ I says, ‘it
ain’t no use to try.’ ‘She’s <i>got</i> to have it,’ Mary Alice
says, ‘whether she wants it or not. It’s a part of
James’s directions.’ Kate begun to holler and throw
out her arms when she saw the oil coming. ‘Take it
away,’ she says; ‘it makes me sick!’ ‘You hold her
hands,’ Mary Alice says, ‘while I pour it on her.’ So
I set down and took a good grip on Kate’s hands, and
Mary Alice poured the oil on her, and it went all over
her face and head and the pillow, she kept threshing
around so lively, and hollering till her mouth was full.
Then Kate she cried and carried on, and said we were
treating her shameful, and would be sorry for it when
she was dead and gone: We never paid any attention
to her, of course, but got down on both sides of the
bed and went to praying as loud and earnest as we
could, so as to drown the groaning. Then Kate said
she didn’t want to be prayed for nohow, that what she
wanted was the doctor. Mary Alice told her she was
plumb out of her senses, and didn’t know what she
was talking about. And Kate said, no such a thing;
that she was a mighty sick woman, but she was in her
right mind, and knew what she wanted, and that it
was the doctor. She said the doctor was the only friend
she had on earth. She said the doctor wouldn’t stand
by and see her die and never lift a hand, and she knew
it. She said he would know of something to give her
that would ease them aches and pains, and let her die
in peace. But she said of course if the <i>doctor</i> was
there she wouldn’t <i>need</i> to die&mdash;that he would save
her. She set up in bed. ‘Melissy Allgood,’ she says,
‘run over and tell your pa to mount his horse and ride
for the doctor,’ she says, ‘and never stop till he finds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
him!’ ‘Land of the living, Kate,’ I says, ‘you know
the doctor is thirty mile and more away, and nobody
knows where he’s at by now.’ ‘Tell Mr. Garry I say
not to stop till he finds him!’ Kate says. ‘And to
keep life in me till he gets here,’ she says, ‘I want old
Dr. Pegram, at Dixie, sent for immediate. He ought
to get here in three hours’ time. You tell Tommy T.
Nickins to take my mare and go for him, quick!’ she
says. ‘And Mary Alice Welden, you go down in the
cellar and bring me one of those bottles of blackberry
cordial, to keep up my strength till Dr. Pegram
comes.’</p>

<p>“Mary Alice and me were smitten dumb right there
where we was at, on our knees. ‘Kate Negley,’ I got
the voice to say, ‘are you sure them are your right-minded
wishes, and not the devil speaking through
you?’ ‘I tell you to do what I say, and hurry up!’
Kate says. ‘Do you reckon I want to die?’</p>

<p>“Mary Alice rose and walked out with never a
word; but if I ever saw complete disgust wrote on anybody’s
face, it was hers. I had to go down and get the
blackberry cordial myself, and you ought to have seen
Kate make away with it. Then I went out and started
off Tommy T. and pa.</p>

<p>“Old Dr. Pegram was there inside of three hours,
dosing out big pills for Kate to take every half-hour,
and powders every fifteen minutes; and it looked like
Kate couldn’t swallow them fast enough to suit her.
Dr. Pegram told ma and me that Kate had a mild case
of the grippe, and there wasn’t no earthly danger.</p>

<p>“When Dr. Negley and pa come poking in after
midnight that night, wore out and muddy, you never
saw as happy a woman in your life as Kate. She
laughed and she cried, and she hugged the doctor, and
she kissed him, and she said there never was anybody
like him, that he was her sweet angel from heaven, and
the dearest darling on earth, and she knew she
wouldn’t have no chance to die, now he had come and
would know just what to do for her. And I reckon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
doctor was the worst-astonished man that ever was;
but he was a heap too polite and kind to let on, and
went on dosing out physic for her just as if there
wasn’t anything out of the common. And never a
word did he ever say to her, either, about having his
camp-hunt broke up; and that’s the reason I <i>know</i>
he’s sanctified, for, like I told ma, what sainted martyr
could do better?</p>

<p>“Of course the Station was shaken to the foundations
over Kate acting that way, and there was a big
time of rejoicing amongst the scoffers. And Mary
Alice Welden hasn’t spoken to Kate since, and says
she never will. But I tell Mary Alice she ought to be
ashamed of herself; that she’s too ready in her judgments,
and needs to make allowance for humans being
humans, and for folks changing with circumstances.”</p>

<h2 class="p2">A DOCTOR’S STORY.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dcc.jpg" width="100" height="119"
alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi110">CROFT HOUSE, at the end of the village, that
had stood vacant so long, was let at last. A
ladder leaned against the wall; a painter was
painting the shutters, a gardener digging in the garden.</p>

<p>Day by day the aspect of the place improved. Soft
muslin shades shrouded the windows, flowers bloomed
where only weeds had grown; the garden paths were
laid with gravel. One night a travelling carriage was
driven rapidly through the village and in at the gate
leading to Croft House.</p>

<p>Whence came the vehicle? Who its occupants? No
one knew, but everyone desired to know. Nothing
that took place within that dwelling transpired outside.
In passing by, one saw only that the standard
roses flourished and that the grass grew greener. What
comments were made on the mysterious and invisible
inhabitants! What strange tales circulated!</p>

<p>I, the village doctor, concerned myself little enough
about the matter. The occupants of Croft House were
no doubt human beings, and as such must suffer some
of the ills that flesh is heir to; in that case my services
would be required. I waited patiently.</p>

<p>A week went by; and one morning before I set off
on my rounds, a messenger arrived requesting me to
call on Mr. Wilton of Croft House. Dressing myself
with more than ordinary care, I crossed the village
green. I was young, and felt important.</p>

<p>I was shown into the drawing-room. It was gay
with summer flowers, redolent of their perfume. On
a couch lay a young girl, in appearance almost a child.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
She was pale, delicate looking, and very lovely. In
front of her knelt a young man of two or three and
twenty&mdash;one of the handsomest young fellows I had
ever seen. He held the hands of the beautiful girl, and
they were looking into each other’s eyes. As I approached
he rose, bowed, and welcomed me with an
easy grace that won my heart.</p>

<p>“I confess I expected to find the village doctor an
older man,” he said with a frank smile as he offered
me his hand. “It is for my wife I desired your attendance,”
he continued, looking at her with the deepest
affection. “Una is not strong.”</p>

<p>Then at a sign from him, I sat down beside the
couch of my interesting patient.</p>

<p>“You are very young, Mrs. Wilton,” I remarked.
It was certainly rather a leading question.</p>

<p>“I am seventeen, doctor,” she answered simply.
“We have been married only a few months. We are
strangers here, and wish to be so. Oh, Charlie, please
explain,” she asked, turning to her husband with a
faint blush. “You can do it better far than I.”</p>

<p>He bent over, kissed her on the forehead, then
straightening himself and looking at me, said: “In
attending my wife, Dr. Gray, I must ask you to undertake
a double duty. We have decided to tell you our
secret&mdash;in part&mdash;so that while <i>we</i> are your patients,
I trust we may look upon <i>you</i> as our friend&mdash;one who
will assist us in keeping our secret and in living the
entirely secluded life we desire to lead here. Wilton
is an assumed name. My father refused to acknowledge
my marriage with the girl I love. <i>Her</i> father
withheld his consent to his daughter marrying into a
family too proud to receive her. We would have
waited any reasonable time; but, when our parents
sought to separate us entirely, we took our lives into
our own hands. We married, and hope&mdash;in time&mdash;to
be forgiven.”</p>

<p>They had both spoken to me with the candour of
youth, of love, and of inexperience. It takes very little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
sometimes to bring a doctor into close relations with
his patients. I seemed to become the friend of this
interesting young couple at once. I assured them they
need not fear being intruded upon by the villagers,
and the only gentlemen’s residences within calling distance
were tenantless at that season of the year, the
owners either being up in London or travelling abroad.
As to the vicar, he was a man whose advanced age and
infirmities effectually precluded him from visiting
more than was absolutely necessary among his parishioners.</p>

<p>“If you go to the church&mdash;a mile from here,” said
I, “he may or may not call upon you. If you do not
go, I think I may safely say he will not consider it
necessary. In that case you will probably never meet.”</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Wilton thanked me warmly, pressing
me to come to see them frequently, which I did with
ever-increasing pleasure as the beautiful romance of
these two loving hearts unfolded itself. I soon discovered
that Mr. Wilton had received a college education;
I also gleaned that “Una” was somewhat his
inferior in social position, and that since their runaway
marriage they had been travelling abroad. It
was no business of mine to know more than they chose
to tell. I respected their secret, and asked no questions.</p>

<p>One morning&mdash;my visits had become almost daily
now&mdash;I saw at once that there was something wrong
with Mrs. Wilton, and she saw also that I perceived it.</p>

<p>“You need not feel my pulse, doctor; it is my
heart,” she said in answer to my looks. “You will
think me foolishly weak, I know,” she added, forcing
a smile, “but I am miserable because my husband is
going to leave me.”</p>

<p>“Leave you! For how long?” I inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>She blushed, and, looking down, answered shyly,
“Till this evening. Ah, don’t laugh,” she implored;
“we have never been separated for so long since we
were married. I am nervous and fanciful, I suppose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
but I scarcely slept last night for thinking of it, and
when I did, a dreadful dream kept repeating itself&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh, you must not mind dreams,” I answered.</p>

<p>“I never did much before, but this&mdash;ah, Charlie!”
she cried, as Mr. Wilton came in booted and spurred,
“I will come and see you mount.”</p>

<p>I saw the parting from the drawing-room window
where I stood&mdash;saw her husband place his hands on
either side of the sweet face, and gaze down into it
with a look of unutterable love; saw their lips meet
together for a moment; after that he kissed her forehead
and her beautiful fair hair, then sprang into the
saddle, and rode off swiftly as though he could not
trust himself to linger longer. At the gate, turning,
he waved a last farewell.</p>

<p>She came into the drawing-room presently.</p>

<p>“Doctor, excuse me. I think I will lie down,” she
said, her large blue eyes looking peculiarly plaintive,
brimming as they were with tears. My presence was
not needed then. I bowed and took my leave.</p>

<p>But the evening of that day I was sent for to Croft
House.</p>

<p>“He has not returned,” were the first words spoken
by Mrs. Wilton, as I entered the drawing-room. “And,
oh! what a day it has been,” she continued feverishly;
“so long, so sad! I seem to have lived a cruel lifetime
in each hour.”</p>

<p>“But it is not late. You said Mr. Wilton would
not return till evening,” I urged.</p>

<p>“It has been evening a long time now. See, the sun
is setting. Then it will be night.” She shuddered.</p>

<p>I sat with her an hour, perhaps, trying in vain to
distract her thoughts. And I too&mdash;knowing not how
or why&mdash;became uneasy. She told me her husband
had gone to D&mdash;&mdash;, the nearest town, for letters he expected
to find at the post-office. I knew that I could
have ridden there and back easily in the time. Still,
a thousand simple causes might have delayed him. I
begged her to take courage, suggesting she would probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
laugh to-morrow at the fears she had entertained
to-day. But she shook her head.</p>

<p>“I suffer too much ever to laugh at such feelings as
these,” she said in a half-whisper. “I do not wish to
think it, but it is as though I <i>knew</i> something dreadful
was&mdash;Oh, I cannot, I dare not clothe the terrible
thought in words. That would make it seem so real&mdash;so
almost certain. Dr. Gray, can this be the punishment
for my disobedience&mdash;<i>come so soon</i>?” she asked
in awe-struck tones.</p>

<p>I could not answer her, but proposed that she should
wrap a mantle round her and come with me into the
garden to watch for her husband. She thanked me
gratefully, and I carried a basket seat out for her and
placed it on the lawn.</p>

<p>Sitting with her hands clasped about her knees&mdash;paler,
more fragile, more childish looking than I had
ever seen her&mdash;of a sudden I felt, rather than saw, that
a change had come to her. She bent forward as
though listening intently, and at the same moment a
distant sound struck on my ear&mdash;the galloping of a
horse on the high road.</p>

<p>Was there ever before on human countenance such a
beatified expression as that which dawned and deepened
on Mrs. Wilton’s as the sound approached? It
was close to us now, but the trees in the garden hid
the road from our view. Without slackening speed
the horse galloped in at the open gate.</p>

<p>“Oh, Charlie, Charlie! Oh, thank God!” cried the
girl, in what seemed a wild, ungovernable ecstasy of
gratitude and joy. But I pulled her back or the horse
would have been upon her.</p>

<p>Then I saw that the animal was riderless, covered
with dust and foam; that the bridle hung loose, dragging
on the gravel.</p>

<p>A groom who had been on the watch came out. In
another moment all the household were assembled on
the lawn.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilton had fallen back, as I thought fainting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
in my arms. But no, her senses had not forsaken her.
She raised herself and pointed in the direction the
horse had come.</p>

<p>“He lies there, there!” she cried, and pushing me
from her, ran forward towards the gate. I bade the
servants bring lanterns and follow me. To Mrs. Wilton,
who was out in the road by this time, I said all I
could say to dissuade her from going with me; but my
words fell on deaf ears. Feeling it was useless&mdash;in
one sense cruel&mdash;to persist, I compelled her to take my
arm. Endowed for the time, by excitement, with almost
superhuman strength, she seemed to drag me forward
rather than to lean on me. After proceeding
about a mile, we came to a bit of level road which for
some distance in front showed clear and distinct in
the moonlight. Here, I felt certain, we had lost all
trace of the horse’s shoe marks, which hitherto had
been every now and again perceptible in the dusty
highway.</p>

<p>“There is a shorter cut&mdash;if he knew of it,” I said,
and stopped.</p>

<p>“Then if there is he would come by it&mdash;he would be
sure to find out and come by it,” she cried.</p>

<p>And I led her back a little distance to a gate at the
entrance of a wood, where sure enough were traces
sufficient to show we were again on the right track.
Servants with lanterns had overtaken us by this time;
so, calling out at intervals and listening in vain for a
response, we entered the dark wood. Through it was
an almost unfrequented bridle path, considered somewhat
unsafe by day but particularly so at night; the
gnarled roots of trees forming a raised network upon
the ground. It was with considerable difficulty we
made our way. Mrs. Wilton stumbled many times,
would have fallen but for my support. At last she
loosed my arm and ran forward, signing me not to
follow her. In another moment the wood resounded
with a wild and piercing cry. She had seen what the
rest of us had failed to see, and when I came up to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
she was kneeling beside her husband, her arms clasped
about his neck, her face close pressed to his. One
agonized look she gave me as I bent over them: “My
dream!” she said. I understood.</p>

<p>There was an ugly wound on the back of poor
Charlie Wilton’s head; the body was still warm, but
the heart had ceased to beat. Though Mrs. Wilton did
not speak again, she never completely lost her senses,
but her mind seemed stunned. We put some hurdles
together and carried him back thus to Croft House.</p>

<p>An inquest was held, every particular of which was
minutely reported in the county newspaper, to appear
in condensed form in most of the journals of the day.
But no friends of the dead man ever came forward,
nor was it satisfactorily proved whether his death had
been the result of violence or of an accidental fall from
his horse in the dangerous pathway through the wood.</p>

<p>The post-office officials at D&mdash;&mdash; perfectly remembered
the deceased calling for letters on the day in
question, giving the name of Wilton; but there were
none for him. In the bank was lodged to his credit
some five or six thousand pounds.</p>

<p>I took upon myself the arrangements for the funeral
as of everything else. Mrs. Wilton’s mind had not sufficiently
recovered from the shock it had received on
that terrible night to understand or care for what went
on around her. Only once&mdash;when I urged writing to
her friends&mdash;did she even momentarily rouse herself
to answer me. “My father will never forgive me,”
she said. “I acted in defiance of his commands. No,
I cannot write to him.” Then she added: “He has
married again,” which perhaps in part explained.</p>

<p>A month later a baby was born&mdash;a boy whom she
called Charlie&mdash;and when she spoke the name, tears
sprang to her eyes for the first time. It was not until
I saw those tears that I had the slightest hope of her
mind rallying from the shock; but then I knew that
the living child would save her. She looked upon him
as having been sent direct from heaven to solace her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
for her loss. She regarded him as an emanation from
the departed spirit of her husband. There was certainly
something uncommon about the child. He was
pretty, but not engaging. He never cried; but it may
also be said, he never smiled. He did not suffer, but
there was about him none of the joyousness of childhood.
It seemed as though the thunder-cloud that
had burst over the mother’s head had left its shadow
on the child.</p>

<p>Between two and three years after Mr. Wilton’s
death a change seemed likely to occur in my own prospects.
A rich relation&mdash;a physician of high standing&mdash;wrote
urging me to come to London immediately,
on a matter, so he said, of the greatest importance to
myself. There was nothing to prevent my complying
with his request. The village was in a healthy state;
my outside practice might be made to spare me. I
wrote stating I would be with him on the following
day.</p>

<p>I went to Croft House to say good-bye. It was summer.
Mrs. Wilton was sitting out on the lawn with
Charlie on a rug close at her feet. She made room
for me beside her, and we talked together for a short
time of her affairs and of the child. It was not until
I had risen to go that I broached the subject of my
departure. She looked surprised, alarmed.</p>

<p>“But, Charlie,” she said; “if he should be ill?”</p>

<p>“I would not go if he were ill. I will return at once
if he should need me,” I answered earnestly. “But is
he not the picture of health? Why, he seems exempt
from every childish trouble.”</p>

<p>I told her my relative’s address, knowing she only
cared to have it in case she needed me for her boy;
then I lifted the child in my arms and kissed him.
“Good-bye, little man!” I said cheerfully. He was a
splendid little fellow, of whom his mother might well
be proud; he resembled his father, too, and was growing
more like him every day.</p>

<p>I was about to set the child down, but something&mdash;some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
feeling I cannot define&mdash;impelled me to hold him
closer; to look into his face&mdash;his eyes&mdash;more scrutinizingly
than I had ever done. And so looking, I shuddered
at the thought that then assailed me. Great
powers! Could fate be so cruel? Had heaven no pity
for this poor mother who, so young, had already surely
borne enough of sorrow? I put the boy down quickly
and turned away.</p>

<p>Perhaps&mdash;perhaps after all I may have been mistaken!</p>

<p>I reached London, and Dr. B&mdash;&mdash; ‘s residence that
evening, and my worthy relative quickly explained the
object of his summons. He wished me to undertake,
with his supervision, a case requiring the utmost care
and consideration; one which rendered it necessary
that a medical man should reside for a time beneath
the same roof as his patient, and be with him night
and day.</p>

<p>This patient was Lord Welbury, a self-made man
so far as his immense wealth was concerned; but he
came of an ancient and honourable race.</p>

<p>I accepted the munificent conditions offered, and
within a couple of hours of my arrival in town was
driven to Lord Welbury’s house in Belgravia, and
entered upon the duties of my post.</p>

<p>For some days and nights my responsibilities
absorbed all my attention. The life of a sick man
hung on a thread, my medical capacity was taxed to
its utmost; I knew not, nor cared I, for the time being,
what went on outside that chamber.</p>

<p>The crisis passed, my patient began rapidly to
recover. The first day that he was able to sit up in
his room he asked me a startling question. He said:
“Doctor, am I sane?”</p>

<p>“Your mind has never been affected,” I answered
unhesitatingly. “Your lordship is as sane as I am.”</p>

<p>“Good. Therefore a will made by me now could not
be invalid?”</p>

<p>“Most certainly not on the ground of incompetency.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then my will must be made to-morrow or next day
at latest. This illness has warned me to delay no
longer. My niece’s child will be my heir.”</p>

<p>His words set me musing and turning over in my
mind how this could be.</p>

<p>“Your lordship is childless, then?” The remark
slipped from me almost unawares; but they were fateful
words, as the result proved. “I beg your pardon,”
I added, seeing surprise and some annoyance written
on his face.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” he answered courteously. “I supposed
you were acquainted with my family affairs, for they
are no secret. I <i>have</i> a son, though no communication
has passed between us for nearly four years. He
set me and my wishes at defiance by marrying
beneath him, consequently will inherit little more
than an empty title. I mean to leave my fortune to
my niece’s child. The boy was committed to my care
when his parents went to India, two years ago. He is
a fine little fellow, and it shows how close in attendance
you have been on me if you did not even know
he was in the house&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Was your son’s name Charles&mdash;that of the girl
he married Una?” I asked, scarcely heeding his last
words. My heart was beating faster than it should,
my voice in my earnestness less steady than it ought
to be.</p>

<p>“Yes. But why these questions?”</p>

<p>I knew he was well enough now to hear the truth,
therefore I answered: “Because it is my belief your
lordship’s son is dead. I will relate to you a sad story;
when I have finished you will be able to judge whether
or not you are concerned in it.” Then I told, as briefly
as I could, the Croft House tragedy; and as I did so,
read in the ever-increasing interest with which he
listened to my tale that my suspicions were correct.</p>

<p>That the man I had to deal with was of a proud,
egotistical, unsympathetic nature I was well aware;
that the death of his only son would not vitally affect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
him I had rightly guessed; but I was scarcely prepared
for the interest he displayed on learning of the
existence of his grandchild. The better nature of the
man seemed touched. I spoke of little Charles’s
beauty, his likeness to his father, even hinted at a
resemblance to Lord Welbury himself. With the feverish
impatience of an invalid he demanded that the
boy should be sent for at once.</p>

<p>“He cannot come without his mother. The two
lives are bound together as one.”</p>

<p>“Then write to the mother and bid her bring him,”
was the imperious reply. And the speaker turned his
face away as though to intimate no more was to be
said. The affair was settled.</p>

<p>On quitting the room I encountered a nurse leading
a smiling, rosy little urchin, clad in velvet and rich
lace.</p>

<p>“Speak prettily to the kind doctor, Georgie,” said
the nurse. “This is the little heir, sir,” she whispered
to me.</p>

<p>Three days later Mrs. Wilton&mdash;I must still call her
so&mdash;and her son arrived. I met them at the station
and took them in one of his lordship’s carriages to
the house. The boy, exhausted apparently by the
journey, was asleep when he entered it; he was still
sleeping when his mother carried him across the
threshold of Lord Welbury’s door.</p>

<p>His lordship’s reception of her was not ungracious.
Could he fail to feel touched at sight of this gentle,
beautiful young creature, who had loved his son so
well! But it was evident he resented the fact that
his grandson, whom he had specially desired to welcome,
could not be prevailed upon to notice him, or
enticed to leave his mother’s arms.</p>

<p>“Excuse him. He is so tired,” pleaded the young
mother, reading the disappointment on her father-in-law’s
face.</p>

<p>“Well, well. Off to bed with him, then. Bring
him to me bright and smiling in the morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Bright and smiling! Somehow the words struck
me&mdash;even haunted me&mdash;they were so totally inapplicable
to Charlie. I tried to remember if I had ever
seen a smile upon that grave baby-face, but tried in
vain.</p>

<p>When I entered Lord Welbury’s room next day&mdash;my
presence there at nights was now dispensed with&mdash;the
old man, in dressing-gown and slippers, was
reclining in an easy chair. In front of him stood Mrs.
Wilton, with Charlie clinging to her long black draperies.</p>

<p>“Come here, Gray,” exclaimed his lordship, irritably.
“I cannot get my grandson to notice me. What
is to be done?”</p>

<p>“Charlie is shy. He has been used to no one but
me,” murmured the mother, raising her eyes with an
appealing look in them to mine.</p>

<p>“Madam, I fear you are spoiling him,” said Lord
Welbury sharply. “The other child took to me at
once, but this&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Send for the other, sir,” I suggested, and presently
“the little heir,” with whom I had previously
made acquaintance, was brought in by his nurse. The
latter sat down in a far corner with some knitting.
The child&mdash;as apparently he had been accustomed to
do&mdash;ran to the old man and scrambled at his knee. “I
love ‘ou, I love ‘ou,” he cried.</p>

<p>Lord Welbury’s face was radiant.</p>

<p>“Now, Charlie, my man,” said he, as the other child
after his affectionate greeting scampered off to play
beside his nurse.</p>

<p>Charlie was placed on his grandfather’s knee.</p>

<p>“Say ‘I love you,’” whispered Mrs. Wilton, as she
tried to clasp her own child’s arms about Lord Welbury’s
neck.</p>

<p>“Say I love ‘ou,” echoed the boy mechanically;
then dropped his head and lay quite placidly as
though he slept.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, the young rascal! He’s making himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
at home at last,” observed Lord Welbury, well
pleased. “And now that I come to see him more
closely, he’s not unlike what his father was at the
same age, only quieter. Do you know he almost
strikes me as being a little dull. Have you found him
so, madam?”</p>

<p>“I have been too sad a companion for him, sir. I
know&mdash;I feel it now,” sighed the poor mother, her eyes
wandering from her own boy to follow the antics of
the other, who astride a stick, was careering merrily
about the room.</p>

<p>“That can be soon remedied,” said Lord Welbury,
putting Charlie off his knee; “let the two youngsters
romp together. I warrant they’ll make friends if let
alone.”</p>

<p>And in order to try the experiment, we three sat
apart and kept up some desultory talk. This lasted
but a short time, however. It was broken in upon by
a startled cry from the younger boy, Georgie, who,
apparently terror stricken, rushed across the room.</p>

<p>“Naughty boy, naughty boy! Send him away. He’s
making faces at me,” cried the spoilt child in an outburst
of passion, pointing with outstretched finger at
his little companion.</p>

<p>The nurse dropped her knitting, and rose instantly.
“I have seen it from the first,” she said, calmly confronting
us. “The child is half an idiot, my lord.”</p>

<p>All eyes were turned at poor Charlie, who stood
among some broken toys, his features distorted into
the ghastly semblance of a smile.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilton, running to her boy, shielded him with
her arms. “My darling, my darling! Has God no
pity?” she cried, and bore him from the room. She
had prayed day and night&mdash;this unhappy mother&mdash;to
see either a smile on her baby’s lips or a tear in his
eye, and hitherto her prayer had been denied. It
was granted now. The poor dulled senses of the child,
roused into something like activity by the antics of his
little lively playfellow, had caused the lips to smile.
But what a smile!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Welbury turned pale. A look of disgust, not
unmixed with anger, settled on his face.</p>

<p>“There is no doubt the boy is imbecile,” he said, as
I was about to follow Mrs. Wilton from the room.
“Dr. Gray, were you aware of this when you allowed
him to be brought here?”</p>

<p>“I was not aware of it,” I replied readily. For the
sad foreboding that first assailed me on the lawn at
Croft House had received no confirmation hitherto.
“But even if the case is as we fear,” I added earnestly,
“it may be curable.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, doctor,” he interrupted. “No man
who has seen that child as we have seen him can have
the slightest doubt but that he is an idiot for life.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, my lord, we must regard the
matter from another point. Remember the shadow
that rested on his mother before his birth. Where
there is no hereditary taint&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What then? On the mere chance of the child
being curable, do you suppose I am going to leave my
money to him? No!” he cried excitedly. “My own
life is too precarious for me to delay longer the settling
of my affairs. My niece’s child is still my heir.
I regard the other as <i>non est</i>. For heaven’s sake don’t
let me have my feelings harrowed by the sight of that
poor idiot any more. The mother shall have a handsome
annuity. I pity her.”</p>

<p>And that day Lord Welbury made his will, leaving
his immense fortune as he had said.</p>

<p>Once more I returned to my country practice; Mrs.
Wilton and Charlie to Croft House.</p>

<p>Never was grief grander in its simplicity, or more
nobly borne than that of Mrs. Wilton. She still
prayed&mdash;prayed with the faith which we are told will
move mountains. Her eyes, when not raised to heaven,
were bent on her child, ever seeking for the dawning
of that intelligence which she believed must come in
answer to her prayers. She tried to teach him his
childish lessons; she read, she talked to him; even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
chanted in a low, sad voice the nursery rhymes that
happy mothers sing.</p>

<p>At last, one day, exercising over herself a supreme
control, she told her son the story of his father’s
death, told it in simple, child-like language, but with a
pathos that might have moved a heart of stone.</p>

<p>The boy was standing at her knee, she holding his
unresponsive hand. But, as she proceeded with her
narration, he pressed gradually closer to her side.
With a thrill of rapture she looked at the drooped eyelids,
hoping, praying to see a tear glisten on the dark
curled lashes. Trembling, she reached the climax of
her sad tale, and bending over him:</p>

<p>“Charlie,” she whispered, “Charlie, he was <i>dead</i>!
you understand?”</p>

<p>Alas, she knew then, even ere she had done speaking
that the boy was incapable of understanding her. His
eyes were closed. He slept!</p>

<p>And he seemed for ever thus. Whether the beautiful
but expressionless eyes were open or closed his
mental faculties were in that dulled dormant state, it
might be said they slept.</p>

<p>“He is like that little statue of Jesus now,” she
once said to me, pointing to a marble figure of Christ,
“but some day God will awaken his soul. Ah, doctor,
shall I live to see that day?”</p>

<p>I scarcely thought she could, but did not tell her so.</p>

<p>From the day on which she related the story of her
husband’s death, she herself drooped visibly.</p>

<p>But grief kills very slowly. Five years passed by.
Lord Welbury was dead. His wealth&mdash;with the exception
of the annuity to his son’s widow&mdash;was left to
his niece’s child; his title now by right became his
grandson’s.</p>

<p>The boy grew fast; he was eight years old, but his
mind still slumbered. He knew the sound of his
mother’s voice, would come to the side of her couch
when called; would lie for hours folded in her arms,
whispering back her loving words, repeating her gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
admonitions like an echo. The words apparently conveyed
no meaning, but they touched some hidden
chord.</p>

<p>Weaker and weaker grew Mrs. Wilton.</p>

<p>On one of my daily visits the sick nurse, who was in
constant attendance now, whispered to me that the
end was near. I was startled, shocked, to perceive
<i>how</i> near!</p>

<p>“Doctor, dear friend,” she gasped very faintly, as
I pressed her poor transparent hand; but her whole
attention was riveted on her son; she was gazing at
him with eyes out of which the light of earth was fading
fast. It was evident she desired to say something,
but it was some time before the words would come.
At last, gathering strength, she said in a low, penetrating
voice that scarcely faltered: “I am going to leave
you, Charlie. <i>Here</i> I could not help you, but when in
heaven I see our dear Lord face to face&mdash;when on my
knees before the great white throne&mdash;”</p>

<p>For an instant an expression of rapture irradiated
her features; the next, with a slight sigh she sank back
upon the pillow.</p>

<p>I touched Charlie on the shoulder. He dropped
upon his knees and, unprompted, joined his trembling
hands in prayer. His gaze was directed upward. His
countenance assumed a look of intensity I had never
seen on it before. Quite suddenly he rose, and flinging
himself sobbing across the bed, “Oh, mother,
mother! Do not leave me all alone,” he cried.</p>

<p>“See! Your son is saved!” I whispered, bending
over Mrs. Wilton. But I was speaking to the dead.</p>

<p>And yet, even as I looked upon the still white face,
the lips seemed parting into a smile of the most holy,
calm, ineffable content. Could it be as she herself had
said? Was she already kneeling before the great
white throne&mdash;had God listened to her prayer at last?</p>

<p>A few more words and this “o’er true tale” is
ended.</p>

<p>From the moment of his mother’s death, the mists
that had obscured poor Charlie’s mind dispersed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>I took him to live with me, and watched his young
intelligence grow day by day to healthy vigour. Not
even a shadowy semblance of a cloud rests now upon
his mind. He has succeeded to his grandfather’s
wealth as well as to the title, for “the niece’s child” is
dead.</p>

<p>The present Lord Welbury ranks amongst England’s
noblest sons&mdash;he is one of the greatest philanthropists
of the day.</p>

<h2 class="p2">JOHN BARTINE’S WATCH: THE DOCTOR’S STORY.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dct.jpg" width="100" height="119"
alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi">“THE exact time? Good heavens! my friend, why
do you insist? One would think&mdash;but what
does it matter; it is easily bed-time&mdash;isn’t that
near enough? But, here, if you must set your watch,
take mine and see for yourself.”</p>

<p>With that, he detached his watch&mdash;a tremendously
heavy, old-fashioned one&mdash;from the chain and handed
it to me, then turned away and, walking across the
room to a shelf of books, began an examination of
their backs. His agitation and evident distress surprised
me; they appeared altogether reasonless. Having
set my watch by his, I stepped over to where he
stood and said, “Thank you.”</p>

<p>As he took his watch and re-attached it to the
guard, I observed that his hands were unsteady. A
slight pallor had come into his face. With a tact, upon
which I greatly prided myself, I sauntered carelessly
to the sideboard and took some brandy and water,
then, begging his pardon for my thoughtlessness,
asked him to have some and went back to my seat by
the fire, leaving him to help himself, as was our custom.
He did so, and presently joined me at the hearth,
as tranquil as if nothing unusual had happened.</p>

<p>This odd little incident occurred in my apartment,
where John Bartine was passing an evening. We had
dined together at the club, had come home in a hack
and, in short, everything had been done in the most
prosaic way; and why John Bartine should break in
upon the natural and established order of things to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
make himself spectacular with a display of emotion,
apparently for his own entertainment, I could nowise
understand.</p>

<p>The more I thought of it, while his brilliant conversational
gifts were commending themselves to my inattention,
the more curious I grew and, of course, had no
difficulty in persuading myself that my curiosity was
friendly solicitude. That is the disguise that curiosity
commonly assumes to evade resentment. So I ruined
one of the finest sentences of his monologue by cutting
it short without ceremony.</p>

<p>“John Bartine,” I said, “you must try to forgive
me, if I am wrong; but with the light that I have at
present I cannot concede your right to go all to pieces
when asked the time o’night. I cannot admit that it
is proper to experience a mysterious reluctance to
look your own watch in the face, and to cherish in my
presence, without explanation, painful emotions which
are denied to me and which are none of my business.”</p>

<p>To this ridiculous speech, Bartine made no immediate
reply, but sat looking gravely into the fire. Fearing
that I had offended, I was about to apologize and
beg him to think no more about the matter, when,
looking me calmly in the eyes, he said:</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, the levity of your manner does
not at all disguise the hidden impudence of your
demand; but happily I had already decided to tell
you what you wish to know, and no manifestation of
your unworthiness to hear it shall alter my decision.
Be good enough to persuade me to have a fresh cigar
and you shall hear all that I can tell you about the
matter.</p>

<p>“This watch,” he said, “had been in my family for
three generations before it fell to me. Its original
owner, for whom it was made, was my great-grandfather,
Bramwell Olcott Bartine, a wealthy planter of
Colonial Virginia and as stanch a Tory as every lay
awake nights contriving new kinds of maledictions for
the head of Mr. Washington, and new methods of aiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and abetting good King George. One day this
worthy gentleman had the deep misfortune to perform
for his cause a service of capital importance
which was not recognized by those who suffered its
disadvantages as legitimate. It does not matter what
it was; but among its minor consequences was my
excellent ancestor’s arrest one night in his own house
by a party of Mr. Washington’s rebels. He was permitted
to say farewell to his weeping family and was
then marched away into the darkness, which swallowed
him up forever.</p>

<p>“Not the slenderest clew to his fate was ever found.
After the war the most diligent inquiry and the offer
of large rewards failed to turn up any of his captors
or any fact concerning him. He had disappeared, and
that was all.”</p>

<p>Something in John Bartine’s manner that was not
in his words&mdash;I hardly knew what it was, or how it
manifested itself&mdash;prompted me to ask:</p>

<p>“What is your view of the matter, Bartine&mdash;of the
justice of it?”</p>

<p>“My view of it,” he flamed out, bringing his
clenched hand down upon the table as if he had been
in a public-house dicing with blackguards&mdash;”my view
of it is that it was a characteristically dastardly
assassination by that d&mdash;d traitor, Washington, and
his ragamuffin rebels!”</p>

<p>For some minutes nothing was said; Bartine was
recovering his temper, and I waited. Then I said:</p>

<p>“Was that all?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;there was something else. A few weeks after
my great-grandfather’s arrest his watch was found
lying on the porch at the front door of his dwelling.
It was wrapped in a sheet of letter-paper bearing the
name of Elizabeth Bartine, his only daughter, my
grandmother. I am wearing that watch.”</p>

<p>Bartine paused. His usually restless black eyes
were staring fixedly into the grate, a point of red light
in each, reflected from the glowing coals. He seemed
to have forgotten my existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>A sudden threshing of the branches of a tree outside
one of the windows, and almost at the same instant a
rattle of rain against the glass, recalled him to a sense
of his surroundings. A storm had risen, heralded by
a single gust of wind, and in a few moments the steady
splash of the water on the pavement was distinctly
audible. I hardly know why I relate that incident;
it seemed somehow to have a certain significance and
relevancy which I am enabled now to discern. It at
least added an element of seriousness, almost solemnity.
Bartine resumed:</p>

<p>“I have a singular feeling towards this watch&mdash;a
kind of affection for it; I like to have it about me;
though partly from its weight, and partly for a reason
that I shall now explain, I seldom carry it. The reason
is this: Every evening when I have it with me I
feel an unaccountable desire to open it and consult it,
even if I can think of no reason for wishing to know
the time. But if I yield to it, the moment my eyes
rest upon the dial I am filled with a mysterious apprehension&mdash;a
sense of imminent calamity. And this is
the more unsupportable the nearer it is to eleven
o’clock&mdash;by this watch, no matter what the actual hour
may be. After the hands have registered eleven the
desire to look is gone; I am entirely indifferent. But
then I can consult the thing as often as I like, with no
more emotion than you feel in looking at your own.</p>

<p>“Naturally, I have trained myself not to look at
that watch in the evening before eleven; nothing could
induce me. Your insistence this evening upset me a
trifle. I felt very much as I suppose an opium-eater
might feel if his yearning for his special and particular
kind of hell were re-enforced by opportunity and
advice.</p>

<p>“Now, that is my story, and I have told it in the
interest of your trumpery science; but if on any
evening hereafter you observe me wearing this
damnable watch, and you have the thoughtfulness to
ask me the hour, I shall beg leave to put you to the
inconvenience of being knocked down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>His humour did not amuse me. I could see that in
relating his hallucination he was again somewhat disturbed.
His concluding smile was positively ghastly,
and his eyes had resumed something more than their
old restlessness; they shifted hither and thither about
the room with apparent aimlessness, and I fancied had
taken on a wild expression, such as is sometimes
observed in cases of dementia. Perhaps this was my
own imagination; but at any rate I was now persuaded
that my friend was afflicted with a most singular
monomania.</p>

<p>Without, I trust, any abatement of my affectionate
solicitude for him as a friend, I began to regard him
as a patient rich in possibilities of profitable study.
Why not? Had he not described his delusion in the
interest of science? Ah, poor fellow, he was doing
more for science than he knew; not only his story but
himself was in evidence. I should cure him if I could,
of course, but first I should make a little experiment
in psychology&mdash;nay, the experiment itself might be a
step in his restoration.</p>

<p>“That is very frank and friendly of you, Bartine,”
I said cordially, “and I’m rather proud of your confidence.
It is all very odd, certainly. Do you mind
showing me the watch?”</p>

<p>He detached it from his waistcoat, chain and all, and
passed it to me without a word. The case was of gold,
very thick and strong, and curiously engraved. After
examining the dial and observing that it was nearly
twelve o’clock, I opened it at the back and was interested
to observe an inner case of ivory, upon which
was painted a miniature portrait in that exquisite and
delicate manner which was in vogue during the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>“Why, bless my soul!” I exclaimed, experiencing
the keenest artistic delight&mdash;”how under the sun did
you get that done? I thought miniature painting on
ivory was a lost art.”</p>

<p>“That,” he replied, gravely smiling, “is not I; it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
my excellent great-grandfather, the late Bramwell
Olcott Bartine, Esquire, of Virginia. He was younger
then than later&mdash;about my age, in fact. It is said to
resemble me; do you think so?”</p>

<p>“Resemble you? I should say so! Barring the
costume, which I supposed you to have assumed out of
compliment to the art&mdash;or for vraisemblance, so to
say&mdash;and the no mustache, that face is yours in every
feature, line and expression.”</p>

<p>No more was said at that time. Bartine took a book
from the table and began reading.</p>

<p>I heard outside the incessant plash of the rain in
the street. There was occasional hurried footfalls on
the sidewalks; and once a slower, heavier tread seemed
to cease at my door&mdash;a policeman, I thought, seeking
shelter in the doorway. The boughs of the trees
tapped significantly on the window-panes, as if asking
for admittance. I remember it all through these
years and years of a wiser, graver life.</p>

<p>Seeing myself unobserved, I took the old-fashioned
watch key from the chain and quickly turned back the
hands of the watch a full hour; then, closing the case,
I handed Bartine his property, and saw him replace it.</p>

<p>“I think you said,” I began, with assumed carelessness,
“that after eleven the sight of the dial no longer
affects you. As it is now nearly twelve”&mdash;looking at
my own timepiece&mdash;”perhaps, if you don’t resent my
pursuit of proof, you will look at it now.”</p>

<p>He smiled good-humoredly, pulled out the watch
again, opened it, and instantly sprang to his feet with
a cry that Heaven has not had the mercy to permit me
to forget! His eyes, their blackness strikingly intensified
by the absolute pallor of his face, were fixed upon
the watch, which he clutched in both hands.</p>

<p>For some time he remained in that attitude without
uttering another sound; then, in a voice that I should
not have recognized as his, he said:</p>

<p>“D&mdash;n you! it is two minutes to eleven.”</p>

<p>I was not unprepared for some such outbreak, and
without rising replied, calmly enough:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“I beg your pardon; I must have misread your
watch in setting my own by it.”</p>

<p>He shut the case with a sharp snap and put the
watch in his pocket. He looked at me and made an
attempt to smile; but his lower lip quivered and he
seemed unable to close his mouth. His hands, also,
were shaking and he thrust them clenched into his
coat pockets.</p>

<p>The courageous spirit was manifestly endeavoring
to subdue the coward body. The effort was too great.
He began to sway from side to side, as from vertigo;
and before I could spring from my chair to support
him his knees gave way and he pitched awkwardly forward
and fell upon his face&mdash;dead!</p>

<p>The post-mortem examination disclosed nothing;
every organ was normal and sound. But when the
body had been prepared for burial a faint, dark circle,
as if made by contusion, was seen to have developed
about the neck; at least, I was so assured by several
persons who said they saw it; but of my own knowledge
I cannot say if that was true.</p>

<p>Nor can I affirm my knowledge of the limitations of
the principle of heredity. I do not know that in the
spiritual, as in the temporal, world natural laws have
no post-facto validity. Surely, if I were to guess at
the fate of Bramwell Olcott Bartine, I should guess
that he was hanged at eleven o’clock in the evening,
and that he had been allowed several hours in which
to prepare for the change.</p>

<p>As to John Bartine, my friend, my patient for five
minutes, and&mdash;Heaven forgive me!&mdash;my victim for
eternity, there is no more to say. He is buried, and
his watch with him; I saw to that. May God rest his
soul in Paradise and the soul of his unfortunate Virginian
ancestor, if, indeed, they are two souls.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi120">DR. BROWN had returned home late from a
visit to one of his patients. It was a serious
case&mdash;doubly so for Brown&mdash;for not only had
his notoriously sure diagnosis failed him in this case,
but the patient was one of a family with which he
had been on an intimate footing for years, and consequently
his personal interest was awakened. The
doctor saw no hope whatever for the sick woman.
Since early morning he had hourly expected her
death. Weary and dispirited, after a light and hasty
supper, he sat down at his writing-table, and once
more passed in review the whole course of his patient’s
illness. Every circumstance was recalled.</p>

<p>“Unaccountable! perfectly unaccountable!” he
murmured over and over again, and, with each repetition,
he shook his grey head.</p>

<p>“Doctor!” Brown started up in alarm. He had
not dreamed that anyone beside himself was in the
room. As he looked up, he saw a lady standing by
the door, dressed in a peculiar nightrobe with only a
light shawl thrown over it.</p>

<p>“My God! What is that?”</p>

<p>It was indeed the subject of his thoughts. Amazed
beyond expression, Brown sprang from his armchair
and hastened toward the intruder. “My dear Madam!
Mrs. Morley, in heaven’s name, why are you here?”</p>

<p>“Never mind, doctor. Sit down and write what I
tell you.”</p>

<p>Brown mechanically obeyed the command. There
was something in the look and bearing of his visitor
which forbade contradiction. Strangely thrilled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Brown took up his pen and wrote at her dictation the
following words: “I hereby direct that, in case of my
death, my body be opened, and the cause of my illness
and final demise be officially and authoritatively stated
by a competent physician. I am convinced that I am
poisoned, and that by my own husband, and only
through such a statement as the aforesaid will it be
put out of his power to get possession of the property
coming to my only child, his step-daughter. My will
relating to this property is in the hands of my lawyer,
Mr. Batt, in London. Mr. Batt is, as I have unfortunately
only lately discovered, a man open to bribery,
and my husband counts upon this characteristic for
the attainment of his object: that is to say, he hopes
to induce this lawyer, by pure falsification, to make
the will read in his favor. I believe he has already
succeeded in doing this, for, when, yesterday, I desired
to see a lawyer of this town, in order to have him take
down my last wishes, my husband put every obstacle
in the way of his coming. I have put a sealed copy of
my will in the double bottom of the little box which
stands always upon the table at my bedside. The
ostensible contents of the box are my daughter’s first
cap and a lock of my father’s hair.”</p>

<p>Dr. Brown had driven his pen as if under the domination
of a higher power. He was not conscious of
having once lifted it from the paper to the inkstand,
and yet there stood the written characters, black and
clear, upon the white paper, and reminded him that he
was not alone; furthermore, that the head and heart
whose wish and request these characters had recorded,
belonged to an existence which held his own being,
thought, and will in its power.</p>

<p>He made an heroic effort to regain the mastery of
himself, and with a powerful shake, as if to free himself
from the grasp of this strange will, he arose.
“Madam, I&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, but, doctor, the master sent me to tell you to
come right away. Mrs. Morley has been lying for two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
hours like dead, and the master thinks it must be
nearly over with her.”</p>

<p>Brown staggered back in amazement, and stared so
vacantly at the waiting coachman that the man was
struck dumb.</p>

<p>“Jan? Where did you come from? Mrs. Morley
is not yet&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Dead? No, doctor, not yet, but the master says
she can’t last much longer.”</p>

<p>“Very well. You see to the horses, and I’ll come
right away.”</p>

<p>Dr. Brown put his hands to his head. He had need
to convince himself by some such means of his own
mortal existence. Then he seized his hat and coat and
hurried after the coachman.</p>

<p>Drawing his coat tightly about him, he leaned back
in the corner of the carriage and racked his brain over
the strange occurrence, but to no purpose. The doctor
was a hard-headed, practical man, and if any one had
related to him the events of the past day, he would
have laughed him to scorn; but, earnestly as he tried
to do so now, it was impossible for him to conjure up
a smile. The carriage stopped and Mr. Morley was at
the door to receive him.</p>

<p>“I am glad you have come, doctor. I was afraid
you would be too late. As the clock struck twelve,
there was absolutely no breath nor pulse, and not
until half-an-hour ago did she seem to come back a
little to life. She has just asked for you.”</p>

<p>These words were spoken outside the sick-room door.
The doctor laid aside his coat and went in, followed
by Mr. Morley. The physician felt something like
horror at being in the near presence of this man, who
since half-an-hour ago had figured in his mind as the
murderer of his wife; and here in the sick-room while
looking upon the dying woman, in whose features he
again saw plainly his recent guest, even here, did he
feel again that compelling force which had put the
pen in his hand at home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The sick woman seemed to have been anxiously
awaiting his coming, for her great, earnest eyes fastened
themselves upon him, as he entered the room,
and as he bent over her, he heard distinctly the low
whispered words: “Doctor, my child!” and in the
same low whisper Dr. Brown replied: “I will see that
your will is executed.”</p>

<p>Then he raised his head and encountered a look
from those eyes which spoke a world of gratitude; and
this was the last conscious look which lighted them,
for as Mr. Morley now softly approached, she looked
wanderingly at him, and then her eyelids closed, and
her muscles relaxed, and with a gentle sigh her heart
ceased to beat.</p>

<p>“All is over,” said the doctor, as he stepped back
to give place to the mourning husband, who threw himself
down beside his wife.</p>

<p>When he arose and turned toward the doctor, a tear
glittered on his lashes. His voice was hoarse and
tremulous when he thanked the physician for all the
pains which he had taken during the long illness of
his wife, concluding with, “I shall never forget it!”</p>

<p>Dr. Brown only shook his head. He was thinking of
the dead woman’s will, and answered evasively: “I
could not have helped your wife much, since I never
discovered the real cause of her illness.”</p>

<p>“No self-reproaches, doctor! You did what you
could, and whether this disease can be exactly diagnosed
seems to me, from what I know of it, altogether
doubtful.”</p>

<p>“Every disease,” replied the doctor, “must finally
disclose its cause to the patient and thorough investigator;
but in this case there were so many accompanying
phenomena that it was quite impossible to discover
the exact cause of the predominant disorder, at
least in the living body.”</p>

<p>The doctor, as he said this, looked sharply at his
companion, over whose countenance a slight cloud
seemed to pass; yet there was scarcely any discernible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
change in his voice as he replied: “No, no, doctor, we
won’t do that! The beloved body was sufficiently tormented
in life; in death at least it shall be at rest!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it was the wish of the dead; and isn’t
there any direction as to that in the will?”</p>

<p>“No!&mdash;yet perhaps&mdash;I don’t know. Anyway the
will is to be read t-omorrow, and should any such direction
be found there&mdash;well, I suppose I shall have to
carry it out. I will send immediately an announcement
of the death to our attorney, Mr. Batt of London.
You will be present at the opening of the will, will
you not?”</p>

<p>“Most certainly!”</p>

<p>The doctor during this conversation had again
approached the bed of death. He carefully scrutinized
the surroundings and, as if in an absent-minded
manner, picked up a little box from the table which
stood beside the bed and carelessly pushed back the
cover. At sight of the contents he could hardly
restrain an exclamation; for there, exactly as had
been described to him, were a baby’s cap, yellow with
time, and a lock of hair, tied with a ribbon.</p>

<p>“Probably some of your wife’s keepsakes?” he
remarked, turning inquiringly to Morley.</p>

<p>“Yes, and as such they must be given into the
hands of her daughter.”</p>

<p>“Will you allow me the pleasure of sending them
to her by my sister who is going to Switzerland
to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it would be more proper that she should
receive them at my hands; and yet, as I shall have to
remain here for some time yet, and a journey home
in her delicate state of health would be hard for the
child, I shall be very much obliged to you if you will
send them to her. Give her my blessing with them,
and tell her that from this time forth I shall be more
a father to her than ever.”</p>

<p>Dr. Brown thrust the little box deep into his breast-pocket,
and took his leave with the assurance that he
would faithfully execute Mr. Morley’s commission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Once at home under the light of the lamp, he was
not long in searching for the further contents of the
box, and he was filled with both horror and astonishment
as his search brought to light, from beneath a
cunningly-contrived double floor, the will as it had
been described to him&mdash;a clear, correct copy. After
this discovery, the doctor awaited with feverish
anxiety the hour for the announced opening of the
will.</p>

<p>At last it arrived, and Brown had to acknowledge
to himself that its contents agreed exactly with the
copy in his hands until it came to the names of the
heirs. Here appeared clearly and plainly, “my
daughter, Mara Dix;” and there, just as plainly, “my
husband, John Morley.” No directions with regard to
an inquest or autopsy appeared therein.</p>

<p>“I demand proof of the genuineness of that will!”
rang loud and clear through the room. No one could
imagine from whom the words proceeded. The will
had been drawn up and carefully preserved by a
prominent attorney in London, and the family
involved was one of the first in the country; and now
came this demand, which, as everybody knew, was an
unmitigated insult. Who had brought it forward?
The chairman looked all about the room. There he
stood&mdash;Dr. Brown! He had again, quite unconsciously,
come under the spell of that mysterious
power, and in obedience to its behest had called out
those words; now that they were spoken, he would not
recall them. Standing upright, the doctor repeated:
“I demand an examination of the will!” As he spoke,
he had the comfortable feeling of having kept a
promise.</p>

<p>“By what authority?” asked the attorney.</p>

<p>“As the guardian of the deceased’s daughter.”</p>

<p>“Have you anything to offer in support of this
request?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a copy of the original will.”</p>

<p>“Will?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“And this has reference to an entirely different
party.”</p>

<p>“Allow me to look at the document.”</p>

<p>Dr. Brown handed over the copy. A committee
retired with it to another room. On their return
the chairman announced that in accordance with Dr.
Brown’s request, a preliminary examination of the
will having been made, the judge had decided to enter
a complaint against Attorney Batt of London for having
falsified the will, and at the same time to place
the property of the heiress-at-law under legal protection.</p>

<p>“Dr. Brown, have you anything further to say in
the matter?”</p>

<p>“I beg you will order an autopsy.”</p>

<p>“On what grounds?”</p>

<p>“It was the wish of the deceased.”</p>

<p>“Is that your only reason?”</p>

<p>“No, but because I have a strong suspicion that the
deceased came to her death through slow and protracted
poisoning.”</p>

<p>All present were filled with horror.</p>

<p>Again the court withdrew, and again the decision
was a fulfilment of the doctor’s request; and when
the verdict at the ensuing inquest was brought in, it
was expressed in one word: Poison!</p>

<h3>A GENERAL PRACTITIONER.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dcd.jpg" width="100" height="120"

</div>
<p class="drop-capi120">DRUMTOCHTY was accustomed to break every
law of health, except wholesome food and
fresh air, and yet had reduced the Psalmist’s
farthest limit to an average life-rate. Our men made
no difference in their clothes for summer or winter,
Drumsheugh and one or two of the larger farmers
condescending to a topcoat on Sabbath, as a penalty
of their position, and without regard to temperature.
They wore their blacks at a funeral, refusing to cover
them with anything, out of respect to the deceased,
and standing longest in the kirkyard when the north
wind was blowing across a hundred miles of snow. If
the rain was pouring at the Junction, then Drumtochty
stood two minutes longer through sheer native dourness
till each man had a cascade from the tail of his
coat, and hazarded the suggestion, hal-fway to Kildrummie,
that it had been “a bit scrowie;” a
“scrowie” being as far short of a “shoor” as a
“shoor” fell below “weet.”</p>

<p>This sustained defiance of the elements provoked
occasional judgments in the shape of a “hoast”
(cough), and the head of the house was then exhorted
by his women folk to “change his feet” if he happened
to walk through a burn on his way home, and
was pestered generally with sanitary precautions. It
is right to add that the gudeman treated such advice
with contempt, regarding it as suitable for the effeminacy
of towns, but not seriously intended for Drumtochty.
Sandy Stewart “napped” stones on the road
in his shirt sleeves, wet or fair, summer and winter,
till he was persuaded to retire from active duty at
eighty-five, and he spent ten years more in regretting
his hastiness and criticising his successor. The
ordinary course of life, with fine air and contented
minds, was to do a full share of work till seventy, and
then to look after “orra” (odd) jobs well into the
eighties, and to “slip awa” within sight of ninety.
Persons above ninety were understood to be acquitting
themselves with credit, and assumed airs of
authority, brushing aside the opinions of seventy as
immature, and confirming their conclusions with illustrations
drawn from the end of last century.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>When Hillocks’ brother so far forgot himself as to
“slip awa” at sixty, that worthy man was scandalized,
and offered laboured explanations at the “beerial.”</p>

<p>“It’s an awfu’ business ony wy ye look at it, an’ a
sair trial tae us a’. A’ never heard tell o’ sic a thing
in oor family afore, an’ it’s no easy accoontin’ for’t.</p>

<p>“The gudewife was sayin’ he wes never the same
sin’ a weet nicht he lost himsel on the muir and slept
below a bush; but that’s neither here nor there. A’m
thinkin’ he sappit his constitution thae twa years he
wes grieve (steward) aboot England. That wes thirty
years syne, but ye’re never the same aifter thae foreign
climates.”</p>

<p>Drumtochty listened patiently to Hillocks’ apologia,
but was not satisfied.</p>

<p>“It’s clean havers aboot the muir. Losh keep’s
(Lord, keep us), we’ve a’ sleepit oot and never been
a hair the waur.</p>

<p>“A’ admit that England micht hae dune the job;
it’s no cannie stravagin’ (strolling) yon wy frae place
tae place, but Drums never complained tae me as if
he hed been nippit in the Sooth.”</p>

<p>The parish had, in fact, lost confidence in Drums
after his wayward experiment with a potato-digging
machine, which turned out a lamentable failure, and
his premature departure confirmed our vague impression
of his character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s awa noo,” Drumsheugh summed up, after
opinion had time to form; “an’ there were waur fouk
than Drums, but there’s nae doot he wes a wee
flichty.”</p>

<p>When illness had the audacity to attack a Drumtochty
man, it was described as a “whup,” and was
treated by the men with a fine negligence. Hillocks
was sitting in the post office one afternoon when I
looked in for my letters, and the right side of his face
was blazing red. His subject of discourse was the
prospects of the turnip “breer,” but he casually explained
that he was waiting for medical advice.</p>

<p>“The gudewife is keepin’ up a ding-dong frae
mornin’ till nicht aboot ma face, and a’m fair deaved
(deafened), so a’m watchin’ for MacLure tae get a
bottle as he comes wast (west); yon’s him noo.”</p>

<p>The doctor made his diagnosis from horseback on
sight, and stated the result with that admirable clearness
which endeared him to Drumtochty.</p>

<p>“Confoond ye, Hillocks, what are ye ploiterin’
aboot here for in the weet wi’ a face like a boiled
beet? Div ye no ken that ye’ve a titch o’ the rose
(erysipelas), and ocht tae be in the hoose? Gae hame
wi’ ye afore a’ leave the bit, and send a haflin (half-grown;
a child) for some medicine. Ye donnerd
idiot, are ye ettlin (intending) tae follow Drums afore
yir time?” And the medical attendant of Drumtochty
continued his invective till Hillocks started,
and still pursued his retreating figure with medical
directions of a simple and practical character.</p>

<p>“A’m watchin’, an’ peety ye if ye pit aff time.
Keep yir bed the mornin’, and dinna show yir face
in the fields till a’ see ye. A’ll gie ye a cry on Monday&mdash;sic
an auld fule&mdash;but there’s no ane o’ them tae
mind anither in the hale pairish.”</p>

<p>Hillocks’ wife informed the kirkyaird that the doctor
“gied the gudeman an awfu’ clearin’,” and that
Hillocks “wes keepin’ the hoose,” which meant that
the patient had tea breakfast, and at that time was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
wandering about the farm buildings in an easy undress
with his head in a plaid.</p>

<p>It was impossible for a doctor to earn even the most
modest competence from a people of such scandalous
health, and so MacLure had annexed neighbouring
parishes. His house&mdash;little more than a cottage&mdash;stood
on the roadside among the pines towards the
head of our Glen, and from this base of operations he
dominated the wild glen that broke the wall of the
Grampians above Drumtochty&mdash;where the snowdrifts
were twelve feet deep in winter, and the only way of
passage at times was the channel of the river&mdash;and
the moorland district westwards till he came to the
Dunleith sphere of influence, where there were four
doctors and a hydropathic. Drumtochty in its length,
which was eight miles, and its breadth, which was
four, lay in his hand; besides a glen behind, unknown
to the world, which in the night time he visited at the
risk of life, for the way thereto was across the big
moor with its peat holes and treacherous bogs. And
he held the land eastwards towards Muirtown so far
as Geordie. The Drumtochty post travelled every
day, and could carry word that the doctor was wanted.
He did his best for the need of every man, woman,
and child in this wild, straggling district, year in,
year out, in the snow and in the heat, in the dark and
in the light, without rest, and without holiday for
forty years.</p>

<p>One horse could not do the work of this man, but
we liked best to see him on his old white mare, who
died the week after her master, and the passing of the
two did our hearts good. It was not that he rode
beautifully, for he broke every canon of art, flying
with his arms, stooping till he seemed to be speaking
into Jess’s ears, and rising in the saddle beyond all
necessity. But he could ride faster, stay longer in
the saddle, and had a firmer grip with his knees, than
any one I ever met, and it was all for mercy’s sake.
When the reapers in harvest time saw a figure whirling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
past in a cloud of dust, or the family at the foot
of Glen Urtach, gathered round the fire on a winter’s
night, heard the rattle of a horse’s hoofs on the road,
or the shepherds, out after the sheep, traced a black
speck moving across the snow to the upper glen, they
knew it was the doctor, and, without being conscious
of it, wished him God speed.</p>

<p>Before and behind his saddle were strapped the
instruments and medicines the doctor might want, for
he never knew what was before him. There were no
specialists in Drumtochty, so this man had to do
everything as best he could, and as quickly. He was
chest doctor and doctor for every other organ as well;
he was accoucheur and surgeon; he was oculist and
aurist; he was dentist and chloroformist, besides being
chemist and druggist. It was often told how he was
far up Glen Urtach when the feeders of the threshing
mill caught young Burnbrae, and how he only stopped
to change horses at his house, and galloped all the
way to Burnbrae, and flung himself off his horse and
amputated the arm, and saved the lad’s life.</p>

<p>“You wud hae thocht that every meenut was an
hour,” said Jamie Soutar, who had been at the threshing,
“an’ a’ll never forget the puir lad lying as white
as deith on the floor o’ the loft, wi’ his head on a
sheaf, an’ Burnbrae haudin’ the bandage ticht an’
prayin’ a’ the while, and the wither greetin’ in the
corner.</p>

<p>“’Will he never come?’ she cries, ‘an’ a’ heard
the soond o’ the horse’s feet on the road a mile awa
in the frosty air.</p>

<p>“’The Lord be praised!’ said Burnbrae, and a’
slippit doon the ladder as the doctor came skelpin’
intae the close, the foam fleein’ frae his horse’s mooth.</p>

<p>“’Whar is he?’ wes a’ that passed his lips, an’ in
five meenuts he hed him on the feedin’ board, and
wes at his wark&mdash;sic wark, neeburs&mdash;but he did it
weel. An’ ae thing a’ thocht rael thoctfu’ o’ him:
he first sent aff the laddie’s mither tae get a bed ready.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“’Noo that’s feenished, and his constitution ’ll dae
the rest,’ and he carried the lad doon the ladder in his
airms like a bairn, and laid him in his bed, and waits
aside him till he wes sleepin’, and then says he: Burnbrae,
yir a gey lad never tae say ‘Collie, will ye
lick?’ for a’ hevna tasted meat for saxteen hoors.”</p>

<p>“It was michty tae see him come intae the yaird
that day, neeburs; the verra look o’ him wes victory.”</p>

<p>Jamie’s cynicism slipped off in the enthusiasm of
this reminiscence, and he expressed the feeling of
Drumtochty. No one sent for MacLure save in great
straits, and the sight of him put courage in sinking
hearts. But this was not by the grace of his appearance,
or the advantage of a good bedside manner. A
tall, gaunt, loosely made man, without an ounce of
superfluous flesh on his body, his face burned a dark
brick colour by constant exposure to the weather, red
hair and beard turning grey, honest blue eyes that
looked you ever in the face, huge hands with wrist
bones like the shank of a ham, and a voice that hurled
his salutations across two fields, he suggested the moor
rather than the drawing-room. But what a clever
hand it was in an operation, as delicate as a woman’s;
and what a kindly voice it was in the humble room
where the shepherd’s wife was weeping by her man’s
bedside. He was “ill pitten thegither” to begin with,
but many of his physical defects were the penalties of
his work, and endeared him to the Glen. That ugly
scar that cut into his right eyebrow and gave him such
a sinister expression, was got one night Jess slipped
on the ice and laid him insensible eight miles from
home. His limp marked the big snowstorm in the fifties,
when his horse missed the road in Glen Urtach,
and they rolled together in a drift. MacLure escaped
with a broken leg and the fracture of three ribs, but he
never walked like other men again. He could not
swing himself into the saddle without making two attempts
and holding Jess’s mane. Neither can you
“warstle” through the peat bogs and snow drifts for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
forty winters without a touch of rheumatism. But
they were honorable scars, and for such risks of life
men get the Victoria Cross in other fields. MacLure
got nothing but the secret affection of the Glen, which
knew that none had ever done one-tenth as much for
it as this ungainly, twisted, battered figure, and I
have seen a Drumtochty face soften at the sight of
MacLure limping to his horse.</p>

<p>Mr. Hopps earned the ill-will of the Glen forever
by criticising the doctor’s dress, but indeed it would
have filled any townsman with amazement. Black he
wore once a year, on Sacrament Sunday, and, if possible,
at a funeral; topcoat or waterproof never. His
jacket and waistcoat were rough homespun of Glen
Urtach wool, which threw off the wet like a duck’s
back, and below he was clad in shepherd’s tartan
trousers, which disappeared into unpolished riding
boots. His shirt was grey flannel, and he was uncertain
about a collar, but certain as to a tie, which he
never had, his beard doing instead, and his hat was
soft felt of four colors and seven different shapes.
His point of distinction in dress was the trousers, and
they were the subject of unending speculation.</p>

<p>“Some threep (declare) that he’s worn thae eedentical
pair the last twenty year, an’ a’ mind masel (myself)
his gettin’ a tear ahint, when he was crossin’ oor
palin’, and the mend’s still veesible.</p>

<p>“Ithers declare ‘at he’s got a wab o’claith, and hes
a new pair made in Muirtown aince in the twa year
maybe, and keeps them in the garden till the new look
wears aff.</p>

<p>“For ma ain pairt,” Soutar used to declare, “a’
canna mak up my mind, but there’s ae thing sure, the
Glen wud not like tae see him withoot them: it wud
be a shock tae confidence. There’s no muckle o’ the
check left, but ye can aye tell it, and when ye see thae
breeks comin’ in ye ken that if human pooer can save
yir bairn’s life it ‘ill be dune.”</p>

<p>The confidence of the Glen&mdash;and tributary states&mdash;was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
unbounded, and rested partly on long experience
of the doctor’s resources, and partly on his hereditary
connection.</p>

<p>“His father was here afore him,” Mrs. Macfadyen
used to explain; “atween them they’ve hed the countyside
for weel on tae a century; if MacLure disna understand
oor constitution, wha dis, a’ wud like tae
ask?”</p>

<p>For Drumtochty had its own constitution and a
special throat disease, as became a parish which was
quite self-contained between the woods and the hills,
and not dependent on the lowlands either for its diseases
or its doctors.</p>

<p>“He’s a skilly man, Doctor MacLure,” continued
my friend Mrs. Macfadyen, whose judgment on sermons
or anything else was seldom at fault; “an’ a
kindhearted, though o’ coorse he hes his faults like
us a’, an’ he disna tribble the Kirk often.</p>

<p>“He aye can tell what’s wrang wi’ a body, an’
maistly he can put ye richt, an’ there’s nae new-fangled
wys wi’ him: a blister for the ootside an’ Epsom
salts for the inside dis his wark, an’ they say there’s
no an herb on the hills he disna ken.</p>

<p>“If we’re tae dee, we’re tae dee; an’ if we’re tae
live, we’re tae live,” concluded Elspeth, with sound
Calvinistic logic; “but a’ll say this for the doctor, that
whether yir tae live or dee, he can aye keep up a shairp
meisture on the skin.</p>

<p>“But he’s no verra ceevil gin ye bring him when
there’s naethin’ wrang,” and Mrs. Macfadyen’s face
reflected another of Mr. Hopps’ misadventures of
which Hillocks held the copyright.</p>

<p>“Hopps’ laddie ate grosarts (gooseberries) till they
hed to sit up a’ nicht wi’ him, and naethin’ wud do
but they maun hae the doctor, an’ he writes ‘immediately’
on a slip o’ paper.</p>

<p>“Weel, MacLure had been awa a’ nicht wi’ a shepherd’s
wife Dunleith wy, and he comes here withoot
drawin’ bridle, mud up tae the een.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“’What’s a dae here, Hillocks?’ he cries; ‘it’s no
an accident, is’t?’ and when he got aff his horse he
cud hardly stand wi’ stiffness and tire.</p>

<p>“’It’s nane o’ us, doctor; it’s Hopps’ laddie; he’s
been eatin’ ower mony berries.’</p>

<p>“’If he didna turn on me like a tiger.</p>

<p>“’Div ye mean tae say&mdash;’</p>

<p>“’Weesht, weesht,’ an’ I tried tae quiet him, for
Hopps wes comin’ oot.</p>

<p>“’Well, doctor,’ begins he, as brisk as a magpie,
‘you’re here at last; there’s no hurry with you Scotch-men.
My boy has been sick all night, and I’ve never
had one wink of sleep. You might have come a little
quicker, that’s all I’ve got to say.’</p>

<p>“’We’ve mair tae dae in Drumtochty than attend
tae every bairn that hes a sair stomach,’ and a’ saw
MacLure was roosed.</p>

<p>“’I’m astonished to hear you speak. Our doctor at
home always says to Mrs. ‘Opps, ‘Look on me as a
family friend, Mrs. ‘Opps, and send for me though it
be only a headache.’”</p>

<p>“’He’d be mair sparin’ o’ his offers if he hed four
an’ twenty mile tae look aifter. There’s naething
wrang wi’ yir laddie but greed. Gie him a gude dose
o’ castor oil and stop his meat for a day, an’ he ‘ill be
a’ richt the morn.’</p>

<p>“’He’ll not take castor oil, doctor. We have given
up those barbarous medicines.’</p>

<p>“’Whatna kind o’ medicines hae ye noo in the
Sooth?’</p>

<p>“’Well, you see, Dr. MacLure, we’re hom&oelig;opathists,
and I’ve my little chest here,’ and oot Hopps
comes wi’ his boxy.</p>

<p>“’Let’s see ‘t,’ an’ MacLure sits doon and taks
oot the bit bottles, and he reads the names wi’ a lauch
every time.</p>

<p>“’Belladonna; did ye ever hear the like? Aconite;
it cowes a’. Nux Vomica. What next? Weel, ma
mannie,’ he says tae Hopps, ‘it’s a fine ploy, and ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
‘ill better gang on wi’ the Nux till it’s dune, and gie
him ony ither o’ the sweeties he fancies.</p>

<p>“’Noo, Hillocks, a’ maun be aff tae see Drumsheugh’s
grieve (steward), for he’s doon wi’ the fever,
an’ it’s tae be a teuch fecht (hard fight). A’ hinna
time tae wait for dinner; gie me some cheese an’ cake
in ma haund, and Jess ‘ill tak a pail o’ meal an’
water.</p>

<p>“’Fee; a’m no wantin’ yir fees, man; wi’ a’ that
boxy ye dinna need a doctor; na, na, gie yir siller tae
some puir body, Maister Hopps,’ an’ he was doon the
road as hard as he cud lick.”</p>

<p>His fees were pretty much what the folk chose to
give him, and he collected them once a year at Kildrummie
fair.</p>

<p>“Weel, doctor, what am a’ awin’ ye for the wife
and bairn? Ye ‘ill need three notes for that nicht ye
stayed in the hoose an’ a’ the veesits.”</p>

<p>“Havers,” MacLure would answer, “prices are
low, a’m hearing; gie’s thirty shillings.”</p>

<p>“No, a’ll no, or the wife ‘ill tak ma ears off,” and
it was settled for two pounds.</p>

<p>Lord Kilspindie gave him a free house and fields,
and one way or other, Drumsheugh told me, the doctor
might get in about one hundred and fifty pounds
a year, out of which he had to pay his old housekeeper’s
wages and a boy’s, and keep two horses, besides
the cost of instruments and books, which he bought
through a friend in Edinburgh with much judgment.</p>

<p>There was only one man who ever complained of
the doctor’s charges, and that was the new farmer of
Milton, who was so good that he was above both
churches, and held a meeting in his barn. (It was
Milton the Glen supposed at first to be a Mormon, but
I can’t go into that now.) He offered MacLure a
pound less than he asked, and two tracts, whereupon
MacLure expressed his opinion of Milton, both from
a theological and social standpoint, with such vigour
and frankness that an attentive audience of Drumtochty
men could hardly contain themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Jamie Soutar was selling his pig at the time, and
missed the meeting, but he hastened to condole with
Milton, who was complaining everywhere of the doctor’s
language.</p>

<p>“Ye did richt tae resist him; it ‘ill maybe roose
the Glen tae mak a stand; he fair hauds them in bondage.</p>

<p>“Thirty shillings for twal veesits, and him no mair
then seeven mile awa, an’ a’m telt there werena mair
than four at nicht.</p>

<p>“Ye ‘ill hae the sympathy o’ the Glen, for a’ body
kens yir as free wi’ yir siller as yir tracts.</p>

<p>“Wes’t ‘Beware o’ gude warks’ ye offered him?
Man, ye chose it weel, for he’s been colleckin’ sae
mony thae forty years, a’m feared for him.</p>

<p>“A’ve often thocht oor doctor’s little better than
the Gude Samaritan, an’ the Pharisees didna think
muckle o’ his chance aither in this warld or that which
is tae come.”</p>

<h2 class="p2">THE VARIOUS TEMPERS OF GRANDMOTHER GREGG.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dcw.jpg" width="100" height="120"
alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi">WHEN the doctor drove by the Gregg farm about
dusk, and saw old Deacon Gregg perched
cross-legged upon his own gate-post, he knew
that something was wrong within, and he could not
resist the temptation to drive up and speak to the old
man.</p>

<p>It was common talk in the neighborhood that when
Grandmother Gregg made things too warm for him
in-doors, the good man, her spouse, was wont to stroll
out to the front gate and to take this exalted seat.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was said by a certain Mrs. Frequent, a
neighbor of prying proclivities and ungentle speech,
that the deacon’s wife sent him there as a punishment
for misdemeanors. Furthermore, this same Mrs. Frequent
did even go so far as to watch for the deacon,
and when she would see him laboriously rise and resignedly
poise himself upon the narrow area, she
would remark:</p>

<p>“Well, I see Grandma Gregg has got the old man
punished again. Wonder what he’s been up to now?”</p>

<p>Her constant repetition of the unkind charge finally
gained for it such credence that the diminutive figure
upon the gate-post became an object of mingled sympathy
and mirth in the popular regard.</p>

<p>The old doctor was the friend of a lifetime, and he
was sincerely attached to the deacon, and when he
turned his horse’s head toward the gate this evening,
he felt his heart go out in sympathy to the old man in
durance vile upon his lonely perch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>But he had barely started to the gate when he heard
a voice which he recognized as the deacon’s, whereupon
he would have hurried away had not his horse
committed him to his first impulse by unequivocally
facing the gate.</p>

<p>“I know three’s a crowd,” he called out cheerily
as he presently drew rein, “but I ain’t a-goin’ to stay;
I jest&mdash;Why, where’s grandma?” be added abruptly,
seeing the old man alone. “I’m shore I heard&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You jest heerd me a-talkin’ to myself, doctor&mdash;or
not to myself, exactly, neither&mdash;that is to say, when
you come up I was addressin’ my remarks to this here
pill.”</p>

<p>“Bill? I don’t see no bill.” The doctor drew his
buggy nearer. He was a little deaf.</p>

<p>“No, I said this pill, doctor. I’m a-holdin’ of it
here in the pa’m o’ my hand, a-studyin’ over it.”</p>

<p>“What’s she a-dosin’ you for now, Enoch?”</p>

<p>The doctor always called the deacon by his first
name when he approached him in sympathy. He did
not know it. Neither did the deacon, but he felt the
sympathy, and it unlocked the portals of his heart.</p>

<p>“Well”&mdash;the old man’s voice softened&mdash;”she thinks
I stand in need of ‘em, of co’se. The fact is, that
yaller-spotted steer run agin her clo’es-line twice-t to-day,
drug the whole week’s washin’ onto the ground,
an’ then tromped on it. She’s inside a-renchin’ an’
a-starchin’ of ‘em over now. An’ right on top o’ that,
I come in lookin’ sort o’ puny an’ peaked, an’ I happened
to choke on a muskitty jest ez I come in, an’
she declared she wasn’t a-goin’ to have a consumpted
man sick on her hands an’ a clo’es-destroyin’ steer at
the same time. An’ with that she up an’ wiped her
hands on her apron, an’ went an’ selected this here
pill out of a bottle of assorted sizes, an’ instructed
me to take it. They never was a thing done mo’ delib’rate
an’ kind&mdash;never on earth. But of co’se you
an’ she know how it plegs me to take physic. You
could mould out ice-cream in little pill shapes an’ it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
would gag me, even ef ‘twas vanilly-flavored. An’ so,
when I received it, why, I jest come out here to meditate.
You can see it from where you set, doctor. It’s
a purty sizeable one, and I’m mighty suspicious of it.”</p>

<p>The doctor cleared his throat. “Yas, I can see it,
Enoch&mdash;of co’se.”</p>

<p>“Could you jedge of it, doctor? That is, of its
capabilities, I mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, of co’se not&mdash;not less’n I’d taste it, an’
you can do that ez well ez I can. If it’s quinine, it’ll
be bitter; an’ ef it’s soggy an’&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t explain no mo’, doctor. I can’t stand it.
I s’pose it’s jest ez foolish to investigate the inwardness
of a pill a person is bound to take ez it would be
to try to lif’ the veil of the future in any other way.
When I’m obligated to swaller one of ‘em, I jest take
a swig o’ good spring water and repeat a po’tion of
Scripture and commit myself unto the Lord. I always
seem foreordained to choke to death, but I notice
thet ef I recover from the first spell o’ suffocation, I
always come through. But I ain’t never took one yet
thet I didn’t in a manner prepare to die.”</p>

<p>“Then I wouldn’t take it, Enoch. Don’t do it.”
The doctor cleared his throat again, but this time he
had no trouble to keep the corners of his mouth down.
His sympathy robbed him for the time of the humor
in the situation. “No, I wouldn’t do it; d&mdash;doggone
ef I would.”</p>

<p>The deacon looked into the palm of his hand and
sighed. “Oh, yas, I reckon I better take it,” he said,
mildly. “Ef I don’t stand in need of it now, maybe
the good Lord ‘ll sto’e it up in my system, some way,
‘g’inst a future attackt.”</p>

<p>“Well”&mdash;the doctor reached for his whip&mdash;”well,
I wouldn’t do it&mdash;<i>steer or no steer</i>!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yas, I reckon you would, doctor, ef you had a
wife ez worrited over a wash-tub ez what mine is. An’
I had a extry shirt in wash this week too. One little
pill ain’t much when you take in how she’s been tantalized.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctor laughed outright.</p>

<p>“Tell you what to do, Enoch. Fling it away and
don’t let on. She don’t question you, does she?”</p>

<p>“No, she ain’t never to say questioned me, but&mdash;Well,
I tried that once-t. Sampled a bitter white capsule
she give me, put it down for quinine, an’ flung it
away. Then I chirped up an’ said I felt a heap better&mdash;and
that wasn’t no lie&mdash;which I suppose was on
account o’ the relief to my mind, which it always did
seem to me capsules was jest constructed to lodge in a
person’s air-passages. Well, I taken notice that she’d
look at me keen now an’ agin, an’ then glance at the
clock, an’ treckly I see her fill the gou’d dipper an’ go
to her medicine-cabinet, an’ then she come to me an’
she says, says she, ‘Open yore mouth!’ An’ of co’se
I opened it. You see that first capsule, ez well ez the
one she had jest adminstered, was mostly morphine,
which she had give me to ward off a ‘tackt o’ the neuraligy
she see approachin’, and here I had been tryin’
to live up to the requi’ements of quinine, an’ wrastlin’
severe with a sleepy spell, which, ef I’d only knew it,
would o’ saved me. Of co’se, after the second dose-t,
I jest let nature take its co’se, an’ treckly I commenced
to doze off, an’ seemed like I was a feather bed
an’ wife had hung me on the fence to sun, an’ I remember
how she seemed to be a-whuppin’ of me, but
it didn’t hurt. That was on account of it bein’ goose-pickin’
time, an’ she was werrited with windy weather,
an’ she tryin’ to fill the feather beds. No, I won’t
never try to deceive her again. It never has seemed to
me that she could have the same respect for me after
ketchin’ me at it, though she ‘ain’t never referred to
it but once-t, an’ that was the time I was elected deacon,
an’ even then she didn’t do it outspoke. She
seemed mighty tender over it, an’ didn’t no mo’n remind
me thet a officer in a Christian church ought to
examine hisself mighty conscientious an’ be sure he
was free of deceit, which, seemed to me, showed a heap
o’ consideration. She ‘ain’t got a deceitful bone in
her body, doctor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, bless her old soul, Enoch, you know thet I
think the world an’ all o’ Grandma Gregg! She’s the
salt o’ the earth&mdash;an’ rock salt at that. She’s saved
too many o’ my patients by her good nursin’, in spite
o’ my poor doctorin’, for me not to appreciate her.
But that don’t reconcile me to the way she doses you
for her worries.”</p>

<p>“It took me a long time to see that myself, doctor.
But I’ve reasoned it out this a-way: I s’pose when she
feels her temper a-risin’ she’s ‘feered thet she might
be so took with her troubles thet she’d neglect my
health, an’ so she wards off any attackt thet might be
comin’ on. I taken notice that time her strawberry
preserves all soured on her hands, an’ she painted my
face with iodine, a man did die o’ the erysipelas down
here at Battle Creek, an’ likely as not she’d heerd of
it. Sir? No, I didn’t mention it at the time for fear
she’d think best to lay on another coat, an’ I felt sort
o’ disfiggured with it. Wife ain’t a scoldin’ woman,
I’m thankful for that. An’ some o’ the peppermints
an’ things she keeps to dole out to me when she’s
fretted with little things&mdash;maybe her yeast’ll refuse
to rise, or a thunder-storm’ll kill a settin’ of eggs&mdash;why,
they’re so disguised thet <i>’cep’n thet I know
they’re medicine&mdash;</i>”</p>

<p>“Well, Kitty, I reckon we better be a-goin’.” The
doctor tapped his horse. “Be shore to give my love
to Grandma, Enoch. An’ ef you’re bound to take
that pill&mdash;of co’se I can’t no mo’n speculate about it
at this distance, but I’d advise you to keep clear o’
sours an’ acids for a day or so. Don’t think, because
your teeth are all adjustable, thet none o’ yore other
functions ain’t open to salvation. <i>Good</i>-night,
Enoch.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she always looks after that, doctor. She’s
mighty attentive, come to withholdin’ harmful temptations.
Good-by, doctor. It’s did me good to open
my mind to you a little.</p>

<p>“Yas,” he added, looking steadily into his palm as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the buggy rolled away&mdash;”yas, it’s did me good to talk
to him; but I ain’t no more reconciled to you, you
barefaced, high-foreheaded, little rolly-poly, you.
Funny how a pill thet ain’t got a feature on earth can
look me out o’ countenance the way it can, and frustrate
my speech. Talk about whited sepulchures, an’
ravenin’ wolves! I don’t know how come I to let on
thet I was feeling’ puny to-night, nohow. I might’ve
knew&mdash;with all them clo’es cedaubled over; though I
can’t, ez the doctor says, see how me a-takin’ a pill is
goin’ to help matters; but of co’se I wouldn’t let on to
him, an’ he a bachelor.”</p>

<p>He stopped talking and felt his wrist.</p>

<p>“Maybe my pulse is obstropulous, an’ ought to be
sedated down. Reckon I’ll haf to kill that steer&mdash;or
sell him&mdash;one, though I swo’e I wouldn’t. But of
co’se I swo’e that in a temper, an’ temp’rate vows
ain’t never made ‘cep’in’ to be repented of.”</p>

<p>Several times during the last few minutes, while
the deacon spoke, there had come to him across the
garden from the kitchen the unmistakable odor of
fried chicken.</p>

<p>He had foreseen that there would be a good supper
to-night, and that the tiny globule within his palm
would constitute for him a prohibition concerning it.</p>

<p>Grandmother Gregg was one of those worthy if
difficult women who never let anything interfere with
her duty as she saw it magnified by the lenses of pain
or temper. It usually pleased her injured mood to
make waffles on wash-day, and the hen-house owed
many renovations, with a reckless upsetting of nests
and roosts, to one of her “splittin’ headaches.” She
would always wash her hair in view of impending
company, although she averred that to wet her scalp
never failed to bring on the “neuraligy.” And her
“neuraligy” in turn meant medicine for the deacon.</p>

<p>It was probably the doctor’s timely advice, augmented,
possibly, by the potencies of the frying-pan,
with a strong underlying sympathy with the worrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
woman within&mdash;it was, no doubt, all these powers
combined that suddenly surprised the hitherto complying
husband into such unprecedented conduct that
any one knowing him in his old character, and seeing
him now, would have thought that he had lost his mind.</p>

<p>With a swift and brave fling he threw the pill far
into the night. Then, in an access of energy born of
internal panic, he slid nimbly from his perch and
started in a steady jog-trot into the road, wiping away
the tears as he went, and stammering between sobs as
he stumbled over the ruts:</p>

<p>“No, I won’t&mdash;yas, I will, too&mdash;doggone shame, and
she frettin’ her life out&mdash;of co’se I sell ‘im
for anything he’ll fetch&mdash;an’ I’ll be a better man, yas,
yas I will&mdash;but I won’t swaller another one o’ them
blame&mdash;not ef I die for it.”</p>

<p>This report, taken in long-hand by an amused listener
by the roadside, is no doubt incomplete in its
ejaculatory form, but it has at least the value of accuracy,
so far as it goes, which may be had only from
a verbatim transcript.</p>

<p>It was perhaps three-quarters of an hour later when
Enoch entered the kitchen, wiping his face, nervous,
weary, embarrassed. Supper was on the table. The
blue-bordered dish, heaped with side-bones and second
joints done to a turn, was moved to a side station,
while in its accustomed place before Enoch’s plate
there sat an ominous bowl of gruel. The old man did
not look at the table, but he saw it all. He would have
realized it with his eyes shut. Domestic history, as
well as that of greater principalities and powers, often
repeats itself.</p>

<p>Enoch’s fingers trembled as he came near his wife,
and standing with his back to the table, he began to
untie a broad flat parcel that he had brought in under
his arm. She paused in one of her trips between the
table and stove, and regarded him askance.</p>

<p>“Reckon I’ll haf to light the lantern befo’ I set
down to eat, wife,” he said, by way of introduction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
“Isrul ‘ll be along d’rec’ly to rope that steer. I’ve
done sold him.” The good woman laid her dish upon
the table and returned to the stove.</p>

<p>“Wish you’d ‘a’ sold ‘im day befo’ yesterday. I’d
‘a’ had a heap less pain in my shoulder-blade.” She
sniffed as she said it; and then she added, “That gruel
ought to be e’t warm.”</p>

<p>By this time the parcel was open. There was a
brief display of colored zephyrs and gleaming cardboard.
Then Enoch began rewrapping them.</p>

<p>“Reckon you can look these over in the mornin’,
wife. They’re jest a few new cross-stitch Bible texts,
an’ I knowed you liked Scripture motters. Where’ll
I lay ‘em, wife, while I go out an’ tend to lightin’ that
lantern? I told Isrul I’d set it in the stable door so’s
as he could git that steer out o’ the way immejate.”</p>

<p>The proposal to lay the mottoes aside was a master-stroke.</p>

<p>The aggrieved wife had already begun to wipe her
hands on her apron. Still, she would not seem too easily
appeased.</p>

<p>“I do hope you ain’t gone an’ turned that whole
steer into perforated paper, Enoch, even ef ’tis Bible-texted
over.”</p>

<p>Thus she guarded her dignity. But even as she
spoke she took the parcel from his hands. This was
encouragement enough. It presaged a thawing out.
And after Enoch had gone out to light the lantern, it
would have amused a sympathetic observer to watch
her gradual melting as she looked over the mottoes:</p>

<p>“A VIRTUOUS WIFE IS FAR ABOVE RUBIES.”</p>

<p>“A PRUDENT WIFE IS FROM THE LORD.”</p>

<p>“BETTER A DINNER OF HERBS WHERE LOVE IS&mdash;”</p>

<p>She read them over and over. Then she laid them
aside and looked at Enoch’s plate. Then she looked
at the chicken-dish, and then at the bowl of gruel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
which she had carefully set on the back of the stove
to keep warm.</p>

<p>“Don’t know ez it would hurt ‘im any ef I’d
thicken that gruel up into mush. He’s took sech a distaste
to soft foods sense he’s got that new set.”</p>

<p>She rose as she spoke, poured the gruel back into the
pot, sifted and mixed a spoonful of meal and stirred it
in. This done, she hesitated, glanced at the pile of
mottoes, and reflected. Then with a sudden resolve
she seized the milk-pitcher, filled a cup from it, poured
the milk into the little pot of mush, hastily whipped
up two eggs with some sugar, added the mixture to
the pot, returned the whole to the yellow bowl, and set
it in the oven to brown.</p>

<p>And just then Enoch came in, and approached the
water-shelf.</p>

<p>“Don’t keer how you polish it, a brass lantern an’
coal ile is like murder on a man’s hands. It will out.”</p>

<p>He was thinking of the gruel, and putting off the
evil hour. It had been his intention to boldly announce
that he hadn’t taken his medicine, that he
never would again unless he needed it, and, moreover,
that he was going to eat his supper to-night, and always,
as long as God should spare him, etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>But he had no sooner found himself in the presence
of long-confessed superior powers than he knew he
would never do any of these things.</p>

<p>His wife was thinking of the gruel too when she
encouraged delay by remarking that he would better
rest up a bit before eating.</p>

<p>“And I reckon you better soak yo’ hands good.
Take a pinch o’ that bran out o’ the safe to ‘em,” she
said, “and ef that don’t do, the Floridy water is in
on my bureau.”</p>

<p>When finally Enoch presented himself, ready for
his fate, she was able to set the mush pudding, done
to a fine brown, before him, and her tone was really
tender as she said:</p>

<p>“This ain’t very hearty ef you’re hungry; but you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
can eat it all. There ain’t no interference in it with
anything you’ve took.”</p>

<p>The pudding was one of Enoch’s favorite dishes,
but as he broke its brown surface with his spoon he
felt like a hypocrite. He took one long breath, and
then he said:</p>

<p>“By-the-way, wife, this reminds me, I reckon you’ll
haf to fetch me another o’ them pills. I dropped that
one out in the grass&mdash;that is, ef you think I still stand
in need of it. I feel consider’ble better’n I did when
I come in this evenin’.”</p>

<p>The good woman eyed him suspiciously a minute.
Then her eyes fell upon the words “ABOVE
RUBIES” lying upon the table. Reaching over, she
lifted the pudding-bowl aside, took the dish of fried
chicken from its sub-station, and set it before her lord.</p>

<p>“Better save that pudd’n’ for dessert, honey, an’
help yo’self to some o’ that chicken, an’ take a potater
an’ a roll, and eat a couple o’ them spring onions&mdash;they’re
the first we’ve had. Sense you’re a-feelin’
better, maybe it’s jest ez well thet you mislaid that
pill.”</p>

<p>The wind blows sometimes from the east in Simkinsville,
as elsewhere, and there are still occasional days
when the deacon betakes himself to the front gate and
sits like a nineteenth-century Simon Stilites on his pillar,
contemplating the open palm of his own hand,
while he enriches Mrs. Frequent’s <i>répertoire</i> of gossip
by a picturesque item.</p>

<p>But the reverse of the picture has much of joy in
it; for, in spite of her various tempers, Grandmother
Gregg is a warm-hearted soul&mdash;and she loves her man.
And he loves her.</p>

<p>Listen to him to-night, for instance, as, having finished
his supper, he remarks:</p>

<p>“An’ I’m a-goin’ to see to it, from this on, thet you
ain’t fretted with things ez you’ve been, ef I can help
it, wife. Sometimes, the way I act, I seem like ez ef I
forgit you’re all I’ve got&mdash;on earth.”</p>

<p>“Of co’se I realize that, Enoch,” she replies.
“We’re each one all the other’s got&mdash;an’ that’s why I
don’t spare no pains to keep you in health.”</p>

<h2 class="p2">DR. BARRÈRE.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dcd.jpg" width="100" height="120" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi120">DR. BARRÈRE was a young man who was beginning
to make his way. In the medical profession,
as in most others, this is not a very
easy thing to do, and no doubt he had made some mistakes.
He had given offence in his first practice to the
principal person in the little town where he had set
up his surgery by explaining that certain symptoms
which his patient believed to mean heart disease were
due solely to indigestion; and he still more deeply offended
that gentleman’s wife by telling her that her
children were over-fed. These are follies which a more
experienced medical man would never commit; but
this one was young and fresh from those studies in
which, more than in any other profession, things have
to be called by their right names. In his next attempt
he had nearly got into more serious trouble still, by his
devotion to an interesting and difficult case, in which,
unfortunately, the patient was a woman. From this
he came out clear, with no stain on his character, as
magistrates say. But for a doctor, as often for a
woman, it is enough that evil has been said. The slander,
though without proof, has more or less a sting,
and is recollected when all the circumstances&mdash;the disproval,
the clearing-up, even the facts of the case have
been forgotten. He was, therefore, not without experience
when he came to settle in the great town of Poolborough,
which might be supposed large enough and
busy enough to take no note of those village lies and
tempests in a teapot. And this proved to be the case.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
He was young, he was clever, he was <i>au courant</i> of all
the medical discoveries, knew everything that had
been discovered by other men, and was not without little
discoveries and inventions of his own. He was still
young, a few years over thirty, at the age which combines
the advantages of youth and of maturity, strong
in mind and in body, loving work, and fearing
nothing. If his previous encounters with the foolish
side of humanity had diminished in some degree his
faith in it, and opened his eyes to the risks which
those who think no evil are apt to run in their first
conflict with the stupidities and base ideas of men, he
had yet not suffered enough to make him bitter, or
more than wary in his dealings with the narrow and
uncomprehending. He no longer felt sure of being
understood, or that a true estimate of his intentions
and motives was certain; but he did not go to the opposite
extreme as some do, and take it for granted that
his patients and their surroundings were incapable of
doing him justice. He was sobered, but not embittered.
He was wise enough neither to show too much
interest, nor to betray too great an indifference. He
listened seriously to the tale of symptoms which were
nothing to anybody but their narrator, and he restrained
his excitement when a matter of real importance,
something delicate and critical, came under his
view. Thus it was proved that he had learned his lesson.
But he did not despise his fellow creatures in
general, or think all alike guilty of affectation and
self-regard, which showed that he had not learned that
lesson with extravagance. He was kind, but not too
kind. He was clever, but not so clever as to get the
alarming character of an experimentalist&mdash;in short,
he was in every way doing well and promising well.
When the untoward accident occurred which cut short
his career in Poolborough where he was universally
well thought of and looked upon as a rising man.</p>

<p>It may be well before going further to indicate certain
particulars in his antecedents which throw light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
upon Dr. Barrère’s character and idiosyncrasies. He
was of French origin, as may be perceived by his
name. The name was not so distinctly French as held
by his father and grandfather, who ignored the
nationality, and wrote it phonetically Barraire. In
their days, perhaps, a French origin was not an advantage.
But in the days when Arnold Barrère was
at college this prejudice had disappeared, and he was
himself delighted to resort to the old orthography, and
liked his friends to remember the accent which it
pleased him to employ. Perhaps the keen logical tendency
of his mind and disposition to carry everything
out to its legitimate conclusion with a severity which
the English love of compromise and accident prevents,
were more important signs of his origin than even the
accent over the e. Dr. Barrère for his part did not
like to elude the right and logical ending either of an
accent or a disease. It annoyed him even that his
patient should recover in an irregular way. He liked
the symptoms to follow each other in proper sequence;
and the end which was foreseen and evident was that
which he preferred to have occur, even when the
avoidance of it, and deliverance of the sufferer were
due to his own powers. Like his nation, or rather like
the nation of his forefathers, he was disposed to carry
out everything to its logical end. His outward man,
like his mind, bore evidence of his parentage. He was
about the middle height, of a light and spare figure,
with a thickly-growing but short and carefully cropped
black beard, his complexion rather dark but very
clear, his voice somewhat high-pitched for an Englishman,
with an animated manner, and a certain sympathetic
action of head and hand when he talked,
scarcely enough to be called gesticulation, yet more
than usually accompanies English speech. He seemed,
in short, to have missed the influence of the two generations
of English mothers and manners which might
have been supposed to subdue all peculiarities of race,
and to have stepped back to the immediate succession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of that Arnold Barrère who was the first to bring the
name to this island. These individual features gave a
certain piquancy, many people thought, to the really
quite English breeding of the doctor, who had never so
much as crossed the Channel, and knew little more
French than was consistent with a just placing of the
accents, especially upon the letter e.</p>

<p>It would be unnecessary to enter into full detail of
how he formed acquaintance with the Surtees, and
came to the degree of intimacy which soon developed
into other thoughts. It is a proper thing enough in a
story, though not very true to real life, to describe a
young doctor as falling in love, by a sick bed, with the
angel-daughter who is the best nurse and ministrant
that a sick parent can have. Members of the medical
profession are not more prone than other men to
mingle their affections with the requirements of their
profession, and probably a devoted nurse is no more
the ideal of a young doctor than a good model is that
of a painter. As a matter of fact, however, it was
while attending Mrs. Surtees through a not very dangerous
or interesting illness that Dr. Barrère made the
acquaintance of Agnes. He might just as well have
met her in the society which he frequented sparingly,
for there was no particular difference in her sphere
and his, but there were reasons why Miss Surtees went
out little, less than most young women of her age. Her
family was one of those which had ranked amongst the
best in Poolborough in the time of their wealth, and
no one could say still that their place was not with
“the best people” of the town. But with a mercantile
community more than any other (though also more or
less in every other) wealth is necessary for the retaining
of that position. Women who go afoot cannot
keep up with those who have carriages and horses at
their command, neither can a girl in whose house no
dances, no dinners, no entertainments, are ever given,
associate long on easy terms with those who are in the
full tide of everything, going everywhere, and exchanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
hospitalities after the lavish fashion of
wealthy commercial society. And this was not the
only reason that kept Agnes Surtees out of the world.
There was one more urgent which was told, and one
which no one named but every one understood. The
first was the delicate health of her mother. Dr. Barrère
was aware that there was not very much in this.
He knew that had she been able to drive about as did
the ladies who were so sorry for her, and clothe herself
in furs and velvet, and take change of air whenever
she felt disposed, there would have been little the matter
with Mrs. Surtees. But he was too sensible to
breathe a word on this subject. He held his tongue at
first from discretion, and afterwards because he had
found out for himself why it was that Mrs. Surtees’
delicate health was kept before the public of Poolborough.
It took him some time to make this discovery;
but partly from hints of others, and partly from
his own perceptions, he found it out at last.</p>

<p>It was that these two ladies were involved in the life
of a third member of their household&mdash;a son and
brother whom the “best people” in Poolborough had
ceased to invite, and whose name when it was mentioned
was accompanied with shakings of the head
and looks of disapproval. Dr. Barrère did not ever
see Jim Surtees until he had been acquainted with his
mother and sister for nearly a year&mdash;not that he was
absent, but only that his haunts and associates were
not theirs. He was a young man who had never done
well. He had been far more highly educated than was
usual with the young men of Poolborough; instead of
being sent into the counting-house in his youth he had
been sent to Cambridge, which was all his father’s
pride and folly, the critics said, exempting Mrs. Surtees
from blame in a manner most unusual. It was
supposed that she had disapproved. She had come of
a Poolborough family, in business from father to son,
and knew what was necessary; but Surtees was from
the country, from a poor race of county people, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
was disposed to think business beneath him, or at least
consider it as a mere stepping-stone to wealth. When
he died so much less well off than was expected, leaving
his family but poorly provided for, then was the
moment when Jim Surtees might have proved what
was in him, and stepped into the breach, replaced his
mother and sister in their position, and restored the
credit of his father’s name. In that case all the old
friends would have rallied around him; they would
have backed him up with their credit, and given him
every advantage. At such moments and in such
emergencies mercantile men are at their best. No one
would have refused the young man a helping hand&mdash;they
would have hoisted him upon their shoulders into
his father’s place; they would have helped him
largely, generously, manfully. Alas! Jim Surtees
did then and there show what was in him. He had
neither energy nor spirit nor ambition, nor any care
for his father’s name or his mother’s comfort. He
said at once that he knew nothing about business.
What could he do? It was entirely out of his way.
He scarcely knew what it was his father dealt in. Cotton?
Yes&mdash;but what did he know about cotton, or
bookkeeping, or anything? The young man was interviewed
by all who knew him; he was sent for by
the greatest merchants in Poolborough. What he
ought to do was set before him by everybody who had
any right to speak, and by a great many who had
none. But nothing moved him. He knew nothing
about business&mdash;he would do nothing in it. Why
should he try what he could not do? And with these
replies he baffled all the anxious counsellors who were
so eager to convince him to the contrary. Then there
were situations suggested, even provided, for him; but
these were all subject to the same objections. Finally
it came about that Jim Surtees did nothing. He had
not been long enough at Cambridge to take his degree.
He was modest about his own capacities even when
pupils were suggested to him. He did not know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
enough to teach, he declared, till his modesty drove the
anxious advisers distracted. What was to be done?
Jim Surtees eluded every expedient to make him do
anything. At last he dropped altogether, and the best
people in Poolborough were conscious of his existence
no more.</p>

<p>These were the circumstances of the Surtees family
when Dr. Barrère made their acquaintance. He
thought for some time that the two ladies lived alone,
and that their withdrawal from society was somewhat
absurd, based as it was on that delusion about Mrs.
Surtees’ health; but a little further information made
him change his mind. He changed his mind about several
things, modifying his first impressions as time
went on. He had thought the mother one of those imaginary
invalids who enjoy that gentle level of ill-health
which does not involve much suffering, and
which furnishes a pretty and interesting <i>rôle</i> for many
unoccupied women; and he had thought her daughter
an angelic creature, whose faith in her mother’s
migraines was such that she cheerfully and sweetly
gave up the pleasures of her youth in order to minister
to them. But as Dr. Barrère changed from a doctor
into a friend; as he began to ask admittance at times
when he was not called for, and when, last seal of a
growing intimacy, he began to venture to knock at the
door in the evening after dinner&mdash;a privilege which
he pleaded for as belonging to the habits of his French
ancestry (of which he knew so little)&mdash;his eyes were
speedily opened to many things which a morning visitor
would never have divined. The first time he did
so, he perceived to his astonishment Agnes on the landing,
half concealed by the turn of the staircase,
eagerly looking down to see who it was; and her
mother, though so little able to move about, was at the
door of the little drawing-room, looking flushed and
wretched, far more ill than when he had been called in
to prescribe for her. For whom was it that they were
looking? It could not be for himself, whom nobody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
had expected, whom they received with a tremulous
kindness, half relieved, half reluctant. After a few
such visits he began to see that the minds of these poor
ladies were divided between pleasure in his society and
fear to have him there. If he stayed a little longer
than usual he saw that they became anxious, the
mother breathless, with a desire to have him go away;
and that even Agnes would accompany him down
stairs with an eager alacrity as if she could not be
comfortable till she had seen him out of the house.
And yet they were always kind, liked him to come,
looked for him, even would say a word which showed
that they had noted his absence if for a week or so he
did not appear; although while he was there they were
ever watchful, starting at every sound, hurrying him
away if he stayed beyond his time. The sight of a tall
figure lurching along the street, of some one fumbling
with a latch-key, of which he was sometimes conscious
as he went away, was scarcely necessary at last to
make him aware what it was that occasioned this anxiety.
Mrs. Surtees saw love dawning in the Doctor’s
eyes. She would not shut out from her patient girl
the chances of a happier lot; but what if the doctor
should meet Jim! See him coming home sodden and
stupid, or noisy and gay. As Dr. Barrère became intimate
they had spoken to him of Jim. He was studying
hard, he was writing, he was always busy, he was
not fond of society. There were so many reasons why
he should never appear. And by and by the doctor,
with a great ache of pity, had learned all these excuses
by heart, and penetrated their secret, and misconstrued
their actions and habits no more.</p>

<p>Finally the doctor made the acquaintance of Jim,
and to his great surprise not only liked him, but understood
why the mother and sister were not always
miserable, how life varied with them from day to day,
and how even Mrs. Surtees was often cheerful, though
never unwatchful, never at ease. Dr. Barrère thought
with justice that nothing could be more miserable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
more inexcusable, than the life the young man was
leading. In theory fate should have put into every
honest hand a whip to scourge such a good-for-nothing.
And sometimes the doctor felt a righteous
wrath, a desire to scourge till the blood came: but it
was not so much out of moral indignation as out of an
exasperated liking, an intolerable pity. What might
happen in the house in those awful moments when all
was silent, and everybody at rest save the mother and
sister watching for Jim’s return at night, neither the
doctor nor any one knew. But at other moments Dr.
Barrère found it impossible to resist, any more than
the women did, the charm of a nature which had not
lost its distinction even in the haunts where he had
lost everything else. He even tried to attract and
draw to himself the prodigal, entertaining visions on
the subject and fancying how, if there were a man
closely connected with the family, himself to wit,
Arnold Barrère, and not merely women who wept and
reproached and condoned and wept again, but never
made a determined stand, nor struck a decisive blow,
there might still be hope for Jim. It could not be said
that this told as a motive in the fervour with which he
offered himself to Agnes Surtees. The doctor was in
love warmly and honestly, and as he made his declaration
thought, as a lover ought, of nothing but Agnes.
Yet when she hesitated and faltered, and after a moment
broke the long silence and spoke to him openly
of her brother, there was the warmth of a personal desire
in the eagerness with which he met her confessions
half way. “Jim is no drawback,” he said eagerly&mdash;”to
me none. I can help you with Jim. If you will
have me there shall be no question of depriving him of
any love or care. He shall have me in addition to help
him to better things.” “Oh,” Agnes had cried, giving
him both her hands in the fervour of love and
trust, “God bless you, Arnold, for speaking of better
things for Jim.” And it was on this holy ground that
their contract was made. Henceforward there were
no concealments from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Barrère was not a man to let the grass grow
under his feet. There was no reason why his marriage
should be delayed. He wanted to have his wife&mdash;a
possession almost indispensable, he assured Mrs. Surtees,
with a smile, to a medical man; and the mother,
anxious to see one child’s fate assured, and still more
anxious, catching with feverish hope at the help so
hopefully offered for the other, had no inclination to
put obstacles in the way. The marriage day was settled,
and all the preparations thereto begun, when the
sudden horror which still envelopes the name of Surtees
in Poolborough arose in a moment, and the following
incidents occurred to Dr. Barrère.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dch.jpg" width="100" height="118" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi120">HE WAS going to visit a patient in a suburb one
dark October night. But it could scarcely be
called dark. There was a pallid moon somewhere
among the clouds whitening the heavy mist that
lay over the half-built environs of the town&mdash;dismal
blank spaces&mdash;fields which were no longer fields,
streets which were not yet streets. The atmosphere
was charged with vapour, which in its turn was made
into a dim, confusing whiteness by the hidden moon.
Everybody knows how dismal are these outskirts of a
great city. A house built here and there stood out
with a sinister solidity against the blank around. New
roads and streets laid out with indications of pavement,
cut across the ravaged fields. Here and there
was a mass of bricks, and there a pool of water. A
piece of ragged hedgerow, a remnant of its earlier
state, still bordered the highway here and there; a
forlorn tree shedding its leaves at every breath of air
stood at the corner where two ways met. Dr. Barrère
was no ways timid, but he felt a chill of isolation and
something like danger as he pushed his way towards
one of the furthest points of the uncompleted road,
where one house stood shivering in the vague damp
and whiteness. He had to cross the other branching
road, at the corner of which stood the shivering poplar,
which shed its leaves as if with a perpetual shrinking
of fear. There he was vaguely aware of something
standing in the shade of the ragged hedgerow&mdash;a
figure which moved as he passed, and seemed to make
a step forward as if awaiting some one. To say that
it was a figure he saw would be too distinct&mdash;he saw a
movement, a something more solid than the mist,
which detached itself as if with a suggestion of watchfulness,
and immediately subsided again back into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
shadows. Dr. Barrère, though he was not timid, felt
the thrill as of a possible danger, the suggestion having
something in it more moving than a distincter
peril. But if there was a man lurking there waiting
for some passer-by, it was not at least for him, and
he walked quickly on, and presently in the interest of
his patient, and in the many thoughts that hurry
through every active brain, forgot the curious hint of
mystery and danger which had for a moment excited
his imagination.</p>

<p>When he approached the spot again on his return,
even the suggestion had died out of his mind. His
eyesight and all his faculties were keen, as befits his
profession, and he saw, without being aware that he
was seeing, everything that came within his range of
vision. Accordingly he perceived without paying any
attention, the vague figure of a man crossing the opening
of the road where the poplar marked the corner,
coming towards him. He saw the solid speck in the
white mist approaching&mdash;then in a moment, in the
twinkling of an eye, this vague silhouette in the night
became a sudden swift scene of pantomimic tragedy,
all done and over in a moment. A sudden movement
took place in the scene; another something, almost less
than a shadow, suddenly came into it from behind the
poplar. No, these words are too strong. What came
into the night was the sound of a crashing blow and a
fall, and another figure, in a different position, standing
over something prostrate, raining down, as in a fit
of frantic passion, blow on blow. Passion, murder,
horror, came in a second into the still confusion of the
misty air. Then, swift as the sudden commotion, came
a pause&mdash;a wild cry of consternation, as if for the first
time the actor in this terrible momentary tragedy had
become aware of what he was doing. The spectator’s
senses were so absorbed in the suddenness of the catastrophe
that there was time enough for the whole
drama to enact itself before he found voice. He had
broken mechanically into a run, and thought that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
called out. But it was not (it seemed to him in the
hurried progression of ideas) his cry or the sound of
his approach, but a sudden horror which had seized
the man (was he a murderer?), who had in a moment
come to himself. When the doctor at full speed, and
calling out mechanically, automatically, for Help!
help! reached the spot where the prostrate figure was
lying, the other had taken flight down the cross road
and was already invisible in the distance. The doctor’s
first care was for the victim. He was not an
avenger of blood, but a healer of men.</p>

<p>Presently there appeared around him two or three
startled people&mdash;one from the nearest house carrying
a small lamp, which made the strangest, weird appearance
in the misty night; a passer-by on his way home;
a vagrant from the deserted fields. They helped the
doctor to turn over the murdered man, who was still
living, but no more, and who, it was evident to Dr.
Barrère’s experienced eyes, was on the point of death
and beyond all human help. The lamp had been
placed on the ground close by, and sent up an odour
of paraffin along with the yellow rays that proceeded
from its globe of light, and the figures kneeling and
bending over the inanimate thing in the midst looked
more like a group of murderers than people bringing
help and succour. Some time had elapsed before the
means of transporting him even to the nearest house
had been procured, and by that time there was no
longer any question of what could be done on his behalf,
and all that was possible was to carry away the
body. Dr. Barrère walked beside the melancholy convoy
to the nearest police station, where he made his
deposition; and then he went home in all the tremor
of excitement and mental commotion. He had fortunately
no visits to pay that evening of any importance;
but he was too much stirred and troubled to remain
quietly at home, and after a while hurried out to
Agnes, his natural confidant, to tell her all about the
shock he had received. It struck him with surprise to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
see, when he entered the little drawing-room, that Jim
was with his mother and sister. It was a thing that
had very seldom happened before. He sat apart from
them at the writing-table, where he was writing, or
making believe to write, letters. The sight of him
struck Dr. Barrère with a certain surprise, but he
could not have told why. There was no reason why he
should not be found in his mother’s drawing-room. It
was true that he was rarely to be seen there, but yet
sometimes he would make his appearance. This evening
he had dressed for dinner, which was still more
unusual: perhaps he was going out to some late evening
party; perhaps some one had been expected to dinner.
These thoughts flew vaguely through Dr. Barrère’s
mind, he could not have told why. There was
no particular reason why he should thus desire to penetrate
the motives of Jim Surtees’ behaviour, or to explain
to himself why the young man was there. The
speculation passed through his head without thought,
if such an expression may be used, without any volition
of his, as half our thoughts do, like the chance
flight of birds or butterflies across the air. They did
not detain him a moment as he came forward with his
greetings, and met the pleased surprise of the reception
which the ladies gave him, “I thought it was too
late to look for you,” his Agnes said, with a brightening
of all the soft lines of her face, as if the sun had
risen upon a landscape. And then, as it was cold, a
chair was drawn for him near the fire. “You have
been kept late on your round to-night,” said Mrs. Surtees.
“Have you any very anxious case?”</p>

<p>“It is no case that has kept me,” said the doctor.
“I have had a dreadful encounter in the road. You
know that district up beyond St. George’s-in-the-fields&mdash;those
half-built, desolate villas and cottages. The
roads are as lonely as if they were in the middle of a
wood. A new quarter by night is as bad as a bare
moor.”</p>

<p>Agnes stood listening with her hand on the back of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
his chair, but still a smile upon her face&mdash;the smile of
pleasure at his coming. Mrs. Surtees had let her knitting
fall upon her lap, and was looking at him, listening
with pleased interest. They had not perceived the
agitation which, indeed, until he began to speak, he
had managed to suppress. “And what happened?”
Mrs. Surtees said.</p>

<p>“I have been,” he answered, his voice breaking in
spite of himself, “the witness of a murder.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” The ladies were too much startled
to put another question except with their eager
eyes. They drew closer to him; the hand of Agnes
glided to his shoulder from the back of his chair.
What she thought first was that his emotion did honour
to him.</p>

<p>Then he described to them briefly what he had seen&mdash;the
lurking figure in the shadow which had alarmed
himself as he passed first, but which he soon perceived
had no hostile intentions towards him; the appearance
of the man approaching from the opposite direction as
he returned; the sudden assault; the rapid, breathless,
horrible suddenness of the tragedy. The ladies hung
upon his lips, making exclamations of horror. It was
not till afterwards that Dr. Barrère became aware that
the young man at the table behind made no sign, said
not a word. He had told everything, and answered
half a dozen hurried, faltering questions before Jim
made any remark. Then he suddenly stirred behind
backs (the group at the fireside having forgotten his
presence) and asked, “What are you talking about?
What’s happened?” in a deep, half growling voice, as
of a man disturbed in his occupation by some fuss of
which he did not grasp the meaning.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Mrs. Surtees wiping her moist eyes,
“did you not hear, Jim? The doctor has seen a murder
committed. God preserve us! I feel as if I had
seen it myself. A dreadful thing like that coming so
near us! It is as if we were mixed up in it,” she said.</p>

<p>“A murder? Are you sure it was a murder? It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
might be nothing more than a quarrel&mdash;how could you
tell in the dark?” said Jim, always in the same gruff,
almost indignant voice.</p>

<p>“If you had seen it as I did you would have been in
no doubt,” said Dr. Barrère, turning half round, and
catching a side view of the tall figure slouching with
hands in his pockets, his face clouded with a scowl of
displeasure, his shoulders up to his ears. This silhouette
against the light gave him a thrill, he scarcely
knew why. He paused for a moment, and then added,
“After all you may be right; it was murder to all intents
and purpose&mdash;but whether it was intended to be
so there may be a doubt.”</p>

<p>“You are always so ready to come to tragical conclusions,”
said Jim in easier tones. “I dare say it will
turn out to have been a quarrel, and no more.”</p>

<p>“A quarrel in which one is killed is apt to look like
murder.”</p>

<p>These words gave them all a shivering sensation.
Even Jim’s shoulders went up to his ears as if he
shared the involuntary shudder&mdash;and Mrs. Surtees
said again, drying her eyes, “It is as if we were mixed
up in it. Poor man, poor man, cut off in a moment,
without a thought!”</p>

<p>“It appears that he is a well known and very bad
character,” said Dr. Barrère. “I feel almost more
sorry for the poor wretch that did it. The cry he gave
when he saw what he had done still rings in my ears.”</p>

<p>“Then you think he did not mean it, Arnold?”</p>

<p>“God knows! You would have said he meant everything
that passion and rage could mean to see the
blows; but that cry&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He repented, perhaps&mdash;when it was too late.”</p>

<p>“It was horror&mdash;it was consternation. It was the
cry of a man who suddenly saw what he had done.”</p>

<p>There was a pause of sympathetic horror and pity.
Then Jim Surtees went back to the writing-table, and
Dr. Barrère continued his conversation with the
ladies, which, however they tried to break into other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and happier subjects, returned again and again to the
terrible scene from which he had just come. They
spoke in low tones together over the fire&mdash;the doctor
recounting over and over again the feelings with
which he had contemplated the extraordinary, sudden
tragedy, the rapidity with which all its incidents followed
each other, leaving him scarcely time to cry out
before all was over. He was naturally full of it, and
could speak of nothing else, and his betrothed and her
mother, always sympathetic, threw themselves entirely
into the excitement which still possessed him. It was
late when he rose to go away, soothed and calmed, and
with a sense of having at last exhausted the incident.
It startled him as he turned round, after taking leave
of Mrs. Surtees, to see that Jim was still there. And
the aspect of the young man was sufficiently remarkable.
The candles on the writing-table behind which
he sat had burned low. They had escaped from the
little red shades which had been placed over them,
and were flaring low, like a level sun in the evening,
upon the figure behind, which, with his head bowed
in his hands and shoulders up to his ears, seemed unconscious
of all that was passing. Jim neither saw nor
heard the doctor move. He was absorbed in some all-important
matter of his own.</p>

<p>Next day Dr. Barrère was still deeply occupied by
the scene he had seen. He was summoned for the coroner’s
inquest, and he was, as was natural, questioned
by everybody he met upon a subject which was in all
men’s mouths. It was equally natural that he should
return next evening to bring the account of all the
encounters he had gone through and all that was news
on the subject to Agnes and her mother. Once more
he noted with surprise that Jim was in the drawing-room.
Was he turning over a new leaf? Had he seen
the folly of his ways at last?</p>

<p>They were sitting as before over the fire, Dr. Barrère
telling his story, the ladies listening with absorbed
attention. The interest of this terrible tragedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
which had taken place almost within their kin, which
they were seeing through his eyes, was absorbing to
them. They wanted to know everything, the most
minute details, what questions had been asked him,
and what he had replied. Jim was still behind backs
at the writing-table with the two candles in their red
shades, which did not betray his face, but threw a
strange light upon his hands and the occupation in
which he seemed to be absorbed. He was playing an
old-fashioned game with small colored glass balls on a
round board, called solitaire in the days when it was
in fashion. The little tinkle of the balls as he placed
them in the necessary order came in during the pauses
in the talk like a faint accompaniment. But no one
looked at him: they were too much absorbed in Dr.
Barrère’s report.</p>

<p>“And are you the only witness, Arnold?” Agnes
asked.</p>

<p>“The only one who saw the deed done,” he said.
“It is very rarely that there is even one witness to the
actual fact of a murder. But there is other evidence
than mine; the man is supposed to have been
seen by various people, and there is a dumb witness of
the first importance, the stick which he must have
thrown away, or which dropped from his hand in the
horror, as I shall always believe of his discovery of
what he had done.”</p>

<p>At this point there was a ring as of the glass balls
all tinkling together on the board. The doctor turned
round, slightly startled in the high tension of his
nerves, and saw that Jim had upset his plaything, and
that the balls were rolling about the table. But this
was far from being an unusual accident in the game,
and neither Mrs. Surtees nor Agnes took any notice,
their nerves were not strained as Dr. Barrère’s had
been. The mother spoke low with a natural thrill of
horror and pity. “And is it known,” she said, “is it
known to whom the stick belongs?”</p>

<p>Before Dr. Barrère could reply there came a knock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
to the door&mdash;a knock not at the door of the room in
which they sat, but below at the street door, a thing
unusual indeed at that hour, but not so startling in
general as to excite or alarm them.</p>

<p>But perhaps all their nerves were affected more or
less. It was very sudden and sharp, and came into
the calm domestic atmosphere with a scarcely comprehensible
shock. They all turned round, and Jim, the
doctor saw, had suddenly risen up, and stood with his
face turned towards the door. The summons rang
through the silence with an effect altogether out of
keeping with its simplicity.</p>

<p>“Who can that be so late,” said Mrs. Surtees.
“Jim, will you go and see?”</p>

<p>“It must be some one for me,” the doctor said.</p>

<p>“Poor Arnold! I hope it is someone near,” said
Agnes faltering&mdash;for neither of them believed what
they said. It was something terrible, something novel,
some startling new event whatever it was. Jim, instead
of doing as his mother wished, sat down again
behind the writing-table, within the shelter of the red
shades on the candles, and they all waited, scarcely
venturing to draw breath. Presently the neat parlor-maid,
pale, too, and with a visible tremor, opened the
door. She said, with a troubled look at her mistress,
that, “Please, there was some one down stairs who
wanted to speak to Mr. Jim.” Mrs. Surtees was the
last to be moved by the general agitation. She said,
“For Mr. Jim? But let him come up, Ellen. Jim,
you had better ask your friend to come upstairs.”</p>

<p>Once more there was a terrible, incomprehensible
pause. Jim, who had fallen rather than re-seated himself
on the sofa which stood behind the writing-table,
said not a word; his face was not visible behind the
shaded lights. Mrs. Surtees threw a glance round her&mdash;a
troubled appeal for she knew not what enlightenment.
Then she said breathlessly, “What has happened?
What is the matter? Who is it? Ellen, you
will show the gentleman up stairs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Heavens! How they stood listening, panic stricken,
not knowing what they were afraid of, nor what there
was to fear. Mrs. Surtees still kept her seat tremulously,
and Jim, lost in the corner of the sofa, suddenly
extinguished the candles&mdash;an act which they all
seemed to approve and understand without knowing
why. And then there came a heavy foot ascending the
stairs. Mrs. Surtees did not know the man who came
in&mdash;a tall soldierly man with a clear and healthful
countenance. It even gave her a momentary sensation
of comfort to see that Jim’s “friend” was no
blear-eyed young rake, but a person so respectable.
She rose to meet him with her old-fashioned courtesy.
“Though I have not the pleasure of knowing you,”
she said with a smile, which was tremulous by reason
of that causeless agitation, “my son’s friends are always
welcome.” Oh heaven above! her son’s friend!
Dr. Barrère was the only one among them who knew
the man. The sight of him cleared the whole matter
in a moment, and shed a horrible light over everything
to the doctor’s eyes. He made a sudden sign to the
newcomer imploring silence.</p>

<p>“I know this gentleman, too, Mrs. Surtees,” he said,
“he is one of my&mdash;friends, also. Would it be taking a
great liberty if I were to ask you to leave us for a few
minutes the use of this room? Agnes, it is a great intrusion&mdash;but&mdash;for
God’s sake take her away!” he said
in his betrothed’s ear.</p>

<p>Mrs. Surtees looked at him with some surprise and
an air of gentle dignity not entirely without offence.
“My dear,” she said to Agnes, “Dr. Barrère would
not ask such a thing without good reasons for it, so let
us go.” She was not a woman who had been accustomed
to take the lead even in her own family, and
she was glad, glad beyond description, to believe that
the business, whatever it was, was Dr. Barrère’s business,
and not&mdash;anything else. She accepted it with a
trembling sense of relief, yet a feeling that the doctor
was perhaps taking a little too much upon him, turning
her out of her own room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>The two men stood looking at each other as the
ladies went away, with Jim still huddled in the corner
of the sofa, in the shade, making no sign. Dr. Barrère
saw, however, that the stranger, with a glance round
of keen, much-practised eyes, had at once seen him,
and placed himself between Jim and the door. When
the ladies had disappeared the doctor spoke quickly.
“Well,” he said, “what is it, Morton? Some new information?”</p>

<p>“Something I regret as much as any one can, Dr.
Barrère. I have to ask Mr. Surtees to come with me.
There need be no exposure for the moment: but I must
take him without delay.”</p>

<p>“Take him!” The doctor made a last effort to appear
not to perceive. He said, “Have you too seen
something, then? Have you further evidence to give,
Jim?”</p>

<p>There was no reply. Neither did the superintendent
say a word. They stood all three silent. Jim had
risen up; his limbs seemed unable to support him. He
stood leaning on the table, looking out blankly over
the two extinguished candles and their red shades.
The officer went up and laid his hand lightly upon the
young man’s shoulder. “Come,” he said, “you know
what I’m here for: and I’m sorry, very sorry for you,
Mr. Jim: but no doubt you’ll be able to make it all
clear.”</p>

<p>“Barrère,” said Jim, struggling against the dryness
in his throat, “you can prove that I have not been out
of the house&mdash;that I was at home all last night. I
couldn’t&mdash;I couldn’t, you know, be in two places at
one time&mdash;could I, Barrère?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Jim, you must remember that whatever you
say now will tell against you at the trial. I take you to
witness, doctor, that I haven’t even told him what it
was for.”</p>

<p>Jim ground out an oath from between his clenched
teeth. “Do I need to ask?” he said. “Doesn’t everybody
know I hated him&mdash;and good reason too&mdash;hated
him and threatened him&mdash;but, God help me, not to
kill him!” cried the young man with a voice of
despair.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dcd.jpg" width="100" height="120" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi120">DR. BARRÈRE was left to break the news to the
mother and daughter. He never knew how he
accomplished this dreadful office. They came
back when they heard the door shut, evidently not
expecting to find him, believing that he had withdrawn
with his “friend”&mdash;and the anxious, searching eyes
with which his Agnes looked around the room, the
mingled terror and pleasure of her look on discovering
him, never faded from his mind. Mrs. Surtees was
more disappointed than pleased. She said, with an
evident sudden awakening of anxiety, “Where is
Jim?” And then he had to tell them. How did he
find words to do it? But the wonderful thing, the
dreadful thing, was that after the shock of the first
intimation there seemed little surprise in the looks of
these poor ladies. The mother sank down in her chair
and hid her face in her hands, and Agnes stood behind
her mother, throwing her arms round her, pressing
that bowed head against her breast. They did not cry
out indignantly that it was not&mdash;could not be true.
They were silent, like those upon whom something
long looked for had come at last. The doctor left them
after a while with a chill in his very soul. He could
say nothing; he could not attempt to console them in
the awful silence which seemed to have fallen upon
them. Agnes tried to smile as he went away&mdash;tried
with her trembling lips to say something. But she
could not conceal from him that she wished him to go,
that he could give no comfort, that the best thing he
could do for them in their misery was to leave them
alone. He went home very miserable in that consciousness
of being put aside, and allowed no share in
the anguish of the woman whom he loved. It was intolerable
to him; it was unjust. He said to himself as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
he walked along that the tacit abandonment of Jim,
the absence of all protest on their part that his guilt
was impossible&mdash;a protest which surely a mother and
sister in any circumstances ought to have made&mdash;was
hard, was unjust. If all the world condemned him,
yet they should not have condemned him. He took
Jim’s part hotly, feeling that he was a fellow sufferer.
Even were he dissipated and reckless, poor fellow,
there was a long, long way between that and murder.
Murder! There was nothing in Jim which could make
it possible that he could have to do with a murder. If
he was hasty in temper, poor fellow, his nature was
sweet, notwithstanding all his errors. Even he,
Arnold Barrère, a man contemptuous of the manner of
folly which had ruined Jim, a man with whom wrath
and revenge might have awakened more sympathy&mdash;even
he had come to have a tenderness for the erring
young man. And to think that Jim could have lain in
wait for any one, could have taken a man at a disadvantage,
was, he declared to himself with indignation,
impossible. It was impossible! though the two women
who were nearest to him&mdash;his mother and his sister&mdash;did
not say so, did not stand up in vindication of the
unhappy youth.</p>

<p>When he had exhausted this natural indignation
Dr. Barrère began to contemplate the situation more
calmly, and to arrange its incidents in his mind. The
horror of the thought that he was himself the chief
witness affected him little at first, for it was to the
fact only that he could speak, and the culprit, so far
as he was concerned, was without identity, a shadow
in the night, and no more. But a chill came over that
flush of indignant partisanship with which he had
made a mental stand for Jim when the other circumstances
flashed upon him. He remembered his own
surprise to find Jim in the drawing-room when he arrived
at Mrs. Surtees’ house; to see his dress so unusual,
though scarcely more unusual than the fact of
his being there. He remembered how the young man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
held aloof, how the candles had flared upon him
neglected. The little scene came before Dr. Barrère
like a picture&mdash;the candle shades standing up in a
ludicrous neglect, the light flaring under them upon
Jim’s face. And then again, to-night: the senseless
game with which he seemed to amuse himself; the
tremble of his hands over the plaything; his absence
of interest in the matter which was so exciting to the
others. Why was Jim there at all? Why did he ask
no question? Why keep behind unexcited, unsurprised,
while the doctor told his story? And then the
reason thrust itself upon him in Jim’s own words&mdash;”I
couldn’t be in two places at once, could I? You can
prove that I was here last night.” Good God, what
did it mean? Jim&mdash;Jim!&mdash;and his mother and sister,
who had sunk into despair without a word, who had
never said as women ought, “We know him better; it
is not true&mdash;it is not true.”</p>

<p>Dr. Barrère went home more wretched than words
can say. Hard and terrible is an unjust accusation;
but oh, how easy, how sweet, how possible, is even the
shame which is undeserved! A century of that is as
nothing in comparison with a day or hour of that
which is merited&mdash;of the horror which is true. He
tried to hope still that it was not true; but he felt coming
over him like a pall, the terror which he could now
perceive had quenched the very hearts in the bosoms
of the two women who were Jim’s natural defenders.
They had not been able to say a word&mdash;and neither
could he. Dr. Barrère stood still in the middle of the
dark street with the damp wind blowing in his face as
all this came before him. A solitary passer-by looked
round surprised, and looked again, thinking the man
was mad. He saw in a moment as by a revelation, all
that was before them&mdash;and himself. The horrible
notoriety, the disgrace, the endless stigma. It would
crush <i>them</i> and tear their lives asunder: but for him
also, would not that be ruin too?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dct.jpg" width="100" height="119" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi110">THE trial took place after a considerable interval,
for the assizes were just over when the man
was killed. In that dreadful time of suspense
and misery proof after proof accumulated slowly with
a gradual drawing together as of the very web of
fate. The stick which was found by the body of the
murdered man was Jim’s stick, with his initials upon
it, in a silver band&mdash;alas, his mother’s gift. He was
proved to have had a desperate quarrel with the man,
who was one of those who had corrupted and misled
him. Then the <i>alibi</i> which had seemed at first so
strong disappeared into worse than nothing when examined: for
Jim had been seen on his flight home; he
had been seen to enter furtively and noiselessly into
his mother’s house, though the servants were ready to
swear that he had not gone out that night; and all the
precautions he had taken, instead of bringing him
safety, only made his position worse, being shown to be
precautions consciously taken against a danger foreseen.
All these things grew into certainty before the
trial; so that it was all a foregone conclusion in the
minds of the townspeople, some of whom yielded to
the conviction with heartfelt pity, and some with an
eager improving of the situation, pointing out to what
horrible conclusions vice was sure to come.</p>

<p>Meanwhile this strange and horrible event, which
had held the town for more than nine days in wonder
and perturbation, and which had given a moral to
many a tale, and point to many a sermon, held one
little circle of unhappy creatures as in a ring of iron&mdash;unable
to get away from it, unable to forget it, their
hearts, their hopes, their life itself, marked forever
with its trace of blood. The two ladies had roused
themselves from their first stupor into a half fictitious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
adoption of their natural <i>rôle</i> as defenders of Jim.
God knows through how many shocks and horrors of
discovery Jim had led them, making something new,
something worse, always the thing to be expected, before
they had come to that pitch that their hearts had
no power to make any protest at all. But when the
morning rose upon their troubled souls they began to
say to each other that it could not be true. It could
not be true! Jim had now and then an <i>accès</i> of sudden
rage, but he was the kind of man of whom it is
said that he would not hurt a fly. How could it be
possible that he would do a murder? It was not possible;
any other kind of evil thing&mdash;but not that, oh,
not that! They said this to each other when they
rose up from the uneasy bed in which mother and
daughter had lain down together, not able to separate
from each other&mdash;though those rules of use and wont
which are so strong on women made them lie down as
if to sleep, where no sleep was. But when the light
came&mdash;that awful light which brings back common life
to us on the morning after a great calamity&mdash;they
looked into each other’s pale faces, and with one voice
said, “Oh no, no, it cannot be!” “Mother,” cried
Agnes, “he would not hurt a fly. Oh, how kind he
was when I was ill, when you had your accident&mdash;do
you remember?” Who does not know what these
words are&mdash;Do you remember? All that he was who
is dead; all that he might have been who is lost;
all the hopes, the happy prospects, the cheerful days
before trouble came. No words more poignant can be
said. They did not need to ask each other what they
remembered&mdash;that was enough. They clasped each
other, and kissed with trembling lips, and then Agnes
rose, bidding her mother rest, and went to fetch her
the woman’s cordial, the cup of tea&mdash;which is so often
all one poor female creature can offer to another by
way of help.</p>

<p>No, no, he could not have done it! They took a little
comfort for the moment. And another strange comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
they took in a thing which was one of the most
damning pieces of evidence against Jim: which was
that he had quarreled violently with the murdered
man and denounced him, and declared hatred and
everlasting enmity against him. The story of the
quarrel as it was told to them brought tears, which
were almost tears of joy, to Mrs. Surtees’ eyes. The
man who had been killed was one of those adventurers
who haunt the outskirts of society wherever there are
victims to be found. He had preyed upon the lives
and souls of young men in Poolborough since the days
when Jim Surtees was an innocent and credulous boy.
It was not this man’s fault that Jim had gone astray,
for Jim, alas, was all ready for his fall, and eager
after everything that was forbidden; but in the fits of
remorse and misery which sometimes came upon him
it was perhaps no wonder if he laid it at Langton’s
door; and that the mother should have held Langton
responsible, who could wonder? The facts of the
quarrel were as so many nails in Jim’s coffin: but God
help the poor woman, they gave consolation to his
mother’s heart. They meant repentance, she thought,
they meant generosity and a pathetic indignation, and
more, they meant succour; for the quarrel had arisen
over an unfortunate youth whom the blackleg was
throwing his toils around as he had thrown them
around Jim, and whom Mrs. Surtees believed Jim had
saved by exposing the villain. The story was told reluctantly,
delicately, to the poor ladies, as almost sealing
Jim’s fate: and to the consternation of the narrator,
who was struck dumb, and could only stare at them
in a kind of stupor of astonishment, they looked at each
other and broke forth into cries at first inarticulate
which were almost cries of joy. “You do not see the
bearing of it, I fear,” said the solicitor who had the
management of the case, as soon as out of his astonishment
he had recovered his voice. “Oh sir,” cried
Mrs. Surtees, “what I see is this, that my boy has
saved another poor woman’s son, God bless him! and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
that will not be forgotten, that will not be forgotten!”
This gentleman withdrew in a state of speechless consternation.
“No, it will not be forgotten,” he said to
Dr. Barrère. “I think the poor lady has gone out of
her senses, and little wonder. It is a piece of evidence
which we can never get over.” Dr. Barrère shook his
head, not understanding the women much better than
the lawyer did. This gave them consolation, and yet
it was the seal of Jim’s fate.</p>

<p>Dr. Barrère himself in the long period of waiting
was a most unhappy man. He stood by the Surtees
nobly, everybody said. No son could have been more
attentive than he was to the poor mother who was entirely
broken by this blow, and had suddenly become
an old woman. And he never wavered in his faith
and loyalty to Agnes, who but for that noble fidelity
would, everybody said, have been the most of all to be
pitied. For Agnes was young, and had all her life
before her, with the stain of this crime upon her name;
and if her lover had not stood by her what would have
become of her? The people who had been doubtful of
Dr. Barrère, as half a Frenchman, as too great a theorist,
as a man who had not been quite successful in his
outset, began now to look upon him with increased
respect, and his firmness, his high honour, his disinterestedness
were commented upon on all sides. But in
his heart the doctor was far from happy. His life,
too, seemed in question as well as Jim’s. If the worst
came to the worst, he asked himself, would society,
however sympathetic for the moment, receive the family
of a man who had been hanged&mdash;horrible words!&mdash;without
prejudice? Would there not be a stigma upon
the name of Surtees, and even upon the name of him
who had given his own as a shield to the family of the
murderer? He did his duty&mdash;no man more truly. He
loved his Agnes with all the warmth of an honest
heart, taking his share of all her trouble, supporting
her through everything, making himself for her sake
the brother of a criminal, and one of the objects of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
popular curiosity and pity. All this he did from day
to day, and went on doing it: but still there were
struggles and dreadful misgivings in Dr. Barrère’s
heart. He was a proud man, and except for what he
made by his profession a poor one. If that failed him
he had nothing else to fall back upon, and he already
knew the misery of unsuccess. He knew what it was
to see his practice wasting away, to see his former
patients pass by shamefacedly, conscious of having
transferred their ailments and themselves to other
hands, to be put aside for no expressed reason out of
the tide of life. At Poolborough he had begun to forget
the experiences of his beginning, and to feel that
at last he had got hold of the thread which would lead
him if not to fortune, at least to comfort and the certainties
of an established course of living. Would this
last? he asked himself. Would it make no difference
to him if he identified himself with ruin&mdash;ruin so hideous
and complete? The question was a terrible one,
and brought the sweat to his brow when in chance
moments, between his visits and his cases, between the
occupations and thoughts which absorbed him, now
and then, suddenly, in spite of all the pains he took, it
would start up and look him in the face. “He had a
brother who was hanged,” that was what people would
say; they would not even after a little lapse of time
pause to recollect that it was his wife’s brother. The
brand would go with them wherever he went. “You
remember the great murder case in Poolborough?
Well, these were the people, and the brother was
hanged.” These words seemed to detach themselves
and float in the air. He said them to himself sometimes,
or rather they were said in his ear, without anything
else to connect them. The phrase seemed already
a common phrase which any one might use&mdash;”The
brother was hanged.” And then cold drops of
moisture would come out upon his forehead. And all
the possibilities of life, the success which is dear to a
man, the advancement of which he knew himself capable&mdash;was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
it all to go? Was he to be driven back once
more to that everlasting re-commencement which
makes the heart of a man sick?</p>

<p>These thoughts accompanied Dr. Barrère as he
went and came, a son, and more than a son, to Mrs.
Surtees, and to Agnes the most faithful, the most
sympathetic of lovers. At such a moment, and in face
of the awful catastrophe which had come upon them,
any talk of marriage would have been out of place.
He had, indeed, suggested it at first in mingled alarm
and desperation, and true desire to do his best, in the
first impulse of overwhelming sympathy, and at the
same time in the first glimpse of all that might follow,
and sickening horror of self-distrust lest his resolution
might give way. He would have fled from himself,
from all risks of this nature into the safety of a
bond which he could not break. But Agnes had
silently negatived the proposal with a shake of her
head and a smile of pathetic tenderness. She, too, had
thoughts of the future, of which she breathed no word
to any one, not even to her mother. All that was in
his mind as subject of alarm and misgiving was reflected,
with that double clearness and vivification
which is given to everything reflected in the clear flowing
of a river, in the mind of Agnes. She saw all with
the distinctness of one to whom the sacrifice of herself
was nothing when compared with the welfare of those
she loved. He was afraid lest these alarms might
bring him into temptation, and the temptation be
above his strength; and his soul was disturbed and
made miserable. But to Agnes the matter took another
aspect. All that he foresaw she foresaw, but the
thought brought neither disturbance nor fear. It
brought the exaltation of a great purpose&mdash;the solemn
joy of approaching martyrdom. Arnold should never
suffer for her. It was she who would have the better
part and suffer for him.</p>

<p>The dreadful fact that it was Dr. Barrère only who
had witnessed the murder, and that he would have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
speak and prove what he had seen, became more and
more apparent to them all as the time drew on. His
description of the blows that had been rained down
wildly on the victim, and of the lurking figure in the
shadow whom he had noted, as he passed the first time,
took away all hope that it might be supposed the act
of a momentary madness without premeditation. The
doctor had told his story with all the precision that
was natural to him before he knew who it was that
would be convicted by it; and now it was no longer
possible for him, even had his conscience permitted it,
to soften the details which he had at first given so
clearly, or to throw any mist upon his clear narrative.
He had to repeat it all, knowing the fatal effect it must
have, standing up with Jim’s pale face before him,
with a knowledge that somewhere in a dim corner
Agnes sat with bowed head listening&mdash;to what she
already knew so well. The doctor’s countenance was
as pale as Jim’s. His mouth grew dry as he bore his
testimony; but not all the terrible consequences could
make him alter a word. He could scarcely refrain a
groan, a sob, when he had done; and this involuntary
evidence of what it cost him to tell the truth increased
the effect in the highest degree, as the evidence of an
unwilling witness always does. There was but one
point in which he could help the prisoner; and fortunately
that too had been a special point in his previous
evidence: but it was not until Dr. Barrère got into
the hands of Jim’s advocate that this was brought out.
“I see,” the counsel said, “that in your previous
examination you speak of a cry uttered by the assailant
after the blows which you have described. You
describe it as a cry of horror. In what sense do you
mean this to be understood?”</p>

<p>“I mean,” said Dr. Barrère very pointedly and
clearly&mdash;and if there had been any divided attention
in the crowded court where so many people had come
to hear the fate of one whom they had known from
his childhood, every mind was roused now, and every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
eye intent upon the speaker&mdash;”I mean&mdash;” He paused
to give fuller force to what he said.</p>

<p>“I mean that the man who struck those blows for
the first time realised what he was doing. The cry
was one of consternation and dismay. It was the cry
of a man horrified to see what he had done.”</p>

<p>“The cry was so remarkable that it made a great
impression on your mind?”</p>

<p>“A very great impression. I do not think I have
ever heard an utterance which affected me so much.”</p>

<p>“You were hurrying forward at the time to interpose
in the scuffle. Did you distinguish any words?
Did you recognise the voice?”</p>

<p>“It would give an erroneous impression to say that
I meant to interpose in the scuffle. There was no
scuffle. The man fell at once. He never had a chance
of defending himself. I did not recognise the voice,
nor can I say that any words were used. It was nothing
but a cry.”</p>

<p>“The cry, however, was of such a nature as to
induce you to change your mind in respect to what
had occurred?”</p>

<p>“I had no time to form any theory. The impression
it produced on my mind was that an assault was
intended, but not murder; and that all at once it had
become apparent to the unfortunate&mdash;” Here the
doctor paused, and there was a deep sobbing breath of
intense attention drawn by the crowd. He stopped
for a minute, and then resumed, “It had become
apparent to the&mdash;assailant that he had&mdash;gone too far;
that the consequences were more terrible than he had
intended. He threw down what he had in his hand,
and fled in horror.”</p>

<p>“You were convinced, then, that there was no murderous
intention in the act of the unfortunate&mdash;as
you have well said&mdash;assailant?”</p>

<p>“That was my conviction,” said Dr. Barrère.</p>

<p>The effect made upon the assembly was great. And
though it was no doubt diminished more or less by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
cross-examination of the counsel for the prosecution,
who protested vehemently against the epithet of unfortunate
applied to the man who had attacked in the
dark another man who was proceeding quietly about
his own business, who had lain in wait for him and
assaulted him murderously with every evidence of premeditation,
it still remained the strongest point in the
defence. “You say that you had no time to form any
theory?” said the prosecutor; “yet you have told
us that you rushed forward calling out murder. Was
this before or after you heard the cry, so full of
meaning, which you have described?”</p>

<p>“It was probably almost at the same moment,” said
Dr. Barrère.</p>

<p>“Yet, even in the act of crying out murder, you
were capable of noticing all the complicated sentiments
which you now tell us were in the assailant’s
cry!”</p>

<p>“In great excitement one takes no notice of the
passage of time&mdash;a minute contains as much as an
hour.”</p>

<p>“And you expect us to believe that in that minute,
and without the help of words, you were enlightened
as to the meaning of the act by a mere inarticulate
cry?”</p>

<p>“I tell you the impression produced on my mind,
as I told it at the coroner’s inquest,” said Dr. Barrère,
steadily; “as I have told it to my friends from the
first.”</p>

<p>“Yet this did not prevent you from shouting murder?”</p>

<p>“No; it did not prevent me from calling for help
in the usual way.”</p>

<p>This was all that could be made of the doctor.
It remained the strongest point in poor Jim’s favour,
who was, as everybody saw to be inevitable, condemned;
yet recommended to mercy because of what
Dr. Barrère had said. Otherwise there were many
features in the case that roused the popular pity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
The bad character of the man who had been killed,
the evil influence he was known to have exercised, the
injury he had done to Jim himself and to so many
others, and the very cause of the quarrel in which
Jim had threatened and announced his intention of
punishing him&mdash;all these things, had Jim been tried
in France, would have produced a verdict modified by
extenuating circumstances. In England it did not
touch the decision, but it produced that vague recommendation
to mercy with which pity satisfies itself
when it can do no more.</p>

<p>Dr. Barrère took the unfortunate mother and sister
home. Mrs. Surtees, broken as she was, could not be
absent from the court when her son’s fate was to be
determined. She was as one stricken dumb as they
took her back. Now and then she would put her trembling
hands to her eyes as if expecting tears which
did not come. Her very heart and soul were crushed
by the awful doom which had been spoken. And the
others did not even dare to exchange a look. The
horror which enveloped them was too terrible for
speech. It was only after an interval had passed, and
life, indomitable life which always rises again whatever
may be the anguish that subdues it for a moment,
had returned in pain and fear to its struggle
with the intolerable, that words and the power of communication
returned. Then Dr. Barrère told the
broken-hearted women that both he himself and others
in the town who knew Jim, with all the influence that
could be brought to bear, would work for a revision
of the sentence. It was upon his own evidence that
the hopes which those who were not so deeply, tremendously
interested, but who regarded the case with
an impartial eye, began to entertain, were founded.
“I hope that the Home Secretary may send for me,”
he said; “they think he will. God grant it!” He
too had worked himself into a kind of hope.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Agnes, melting for the first time into
tears at the touch of a possible deliverance, “if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
could go, as they used to do, to the Queen, his mother
and his sister, on our knees!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Surtees sat and listened to them with her immovable
face of misery. “Don’t speak to me of hope,
for I cannot bear it,” she said. “Oh, don’t speak of
hope; there is none&mdash;none! Nothing but death and
shame.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother,” said Dr. Barrère, and he added under
his breath, “whatever happens&mdash;whatever happens&mdash;there
shall be no death of shame.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dct.jpg" width="100" height="119" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi110">THE recommendation to mercy was very strong;
almost all the principal people in the town
interested themselves, and the judge himself
had been persuaded to add a potent word; but as he
did so he shook his head, and told the petitioners that
their arguments were all sentimental. “What does
your lordship say then to the doctor’s testimony?”
was asked him, upon which he shook his head more
and more. “The doctor’s testimony, above all,” he
said. “Mind you, I think that probably the doctor
was right, but it is not a solid argument, it is all sentiment;
and that is what the Home Office makes no account
of.” This was very discouraging. But still
there was a certain enthusiasm in the town in Jim’s
favour, as well as a natural horror that one who really
belonged (if he had kept his position) to the best
class, should come to such an end; and the chief people
who got up this recommendation to mercy were warm
supporters of the Government. That, too, they felt
convinced must tell for something. And there reigned
in Poolborough a certain hope which Dr. Barrère
sometimes shared.</p>

<p>Sometimes; for on many occasions he took the
darker view&mdash;the view so universal and generally received,
that the more important it is for you that a
certain thing should come to pass, the more you desire
it, the less likely it is to happen. And then he would
ask himself was it so important that it should come
to pass? At the best it was still true that Jim had
killed this man. If he were not hanged for it he would
be imprisoned for life; and whether it is worse to
have a relative who has been hanged for a crime or
one who is lingering out a long term of imprisonment
for it, it is hard to tell. There did not seem much to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
choose between them. Perhaps even the hanging
would be forgotten soonest&mdash;and it would be less of a
burden. For to think of a brother in prison, who
might emerge years hence with a ticket-of-leave, a disgraced
and degraded man, was something terrible.
Perhaps on the whole it would be best that he should
die. And then Dr. Barrère shuddered. Die! Ah! if
that might be, quietly, without demonstration. But as
it was&mdash;And then he would begin again, against
his will, that painful circle of thought&mdash;”the brother
was hanged.” That was what people would say.
After the horror of it had died out fantastic patients
would cry, “The brother of a man who was hanged!
Oh, no! don’t let us call in such a person.” The
ladies would say this: they would shudder yet perhaps
even laugh, for the pity would be forgotten, even
the horror would be forgotten, and there would remain
only this suggestion of discomfort&mdash;just enough to
make the women feel that they would not like to have
him, the brother of a man who was hanged, for their
doctor. Dr. Barrère tried all he could to escape from
this circle of fatal thought; but however hard he
worked, and however much he occupied himself, he
could not do so always. And the thought went near
sometimes to make him mad.</p>

<p>He had, however, much to occupy him, to keep
thought away. He was the only element of comfort
in the life of the two miserable women who lived
under the shadow of death, their minds entirely absorbed
in the approaching catastrophe, living through
it a hundred times in anticipation, in despair which
was made more ghastly and sickening by a flicker of
terrible hope. Mrs. Surtees said that she had no hope;
she would not allow the possibility to be named; but
secretly dwelt upon it with an intensity of suspense
which was more unendurable than any calamity. And
when Agnes and her lover were alone this was the subject
that occupied them to the exclusion of all others.
Their own hopes and prospects were all blotted out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
as if they had never been. He brought her reports
of what was said, and what was thought on the subject
among the people who had influence, those who
were straining every nerve to obtain a reprieve: and
she hung upon his words breathless with an all-absorbing
interest. He never got beyond the awful
shadow, or could forget it, and went about all day
with that cloud hanging over him, and frightened his
patients with his stern and serious looks. “Dr. Barrère
is not an encouraging doctor,” they began to
say, “he makes you think you are going to die;” for
the sick people could not divest themselves of the idea
that it was their complaints that were foremost in the
doctor’s mind and produced that severity in his looks.</p>

<p>But all this was light and easy to the last of the
many occupations which filled Dr. Barrère’s time and
thoughts, and that was Jim&mdash;Jim alone in his prison,
he who never had been alone, who had been surrounded
all day long with his companions&mdash;the companions
who had led him astray. No, they had not
led him astray. Langton, who was dead, whom
he had killed, had not led him astray, though he now
thought so, or said so, bemoaning himself. Such a
thing would be too heavy a burden for any human
spirit. A man cannot ruin any more than he can save
his brother. His own inclinations, his own will, his
love for the forbidden, his idle wishes and follies&mdash;these
were what had led him astray. And now he
was left alone to think of all that, with the shadow
before him of a hideous death at a fixed moment&mdash;a
moment drawing nearer and nearer, which he could
no more escape than he could forget it. Jim had many
good qualities amid his evil ones. He was not a bad
man; his sins were rather those of a foolish, self-indulgent
boy. His character was that of a boy. A
certain innocency, if that word may be used, lay under
the surface of his vices, and long confinement
away from all temptation had wrought a change in
him like that that came over the leper in the Scriptures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
whose flesh came again as the flesh of a little
child. This was what happened to Jim, both bodily
and mentally. He languished in health from his confinement,
but yet his eyes regained the clearness of
his youth, and his mind, all its ingenuousness, its
power of affection. Lying under sentence of death
he became once more the lovable human creature, the
winning and attractive youth he had been in the days
before trouble came. All clouds save the one cloud
rolled off his soul. In all likelihood he himself forgot
the course of degradation through which he had gone;
everything was obliterated to him by the impossibility
of sinning more&mdash;everything except the one thing
which no self-delusion could obliterate, the unchangeable
doom to which he was approaching day by day.
Jim had none of the tremors of a murderer. He concealed
nothing; he admitted freely that the verdict
was just, that it was he who had lurked in the dark
and awaited the villain&mdash;but only he had never meant
more than to punish him. “It is all quite true what
the doctor says. I knocked him down. I meant to
beat him within an inch of his life. God knows if
he deserved it at my hands, or any honest man’s
hands. And then it came over me in a moment that
he never moved, that he never made a struggle. It
was not because there were people coming up that I
ran away. It was horror, as the doctor says. Nothing
can ever happen to me again so dreadful as that,”
said Jim, putting up his handkerchief to wipe his
damp forehead. And yet he could tell even that story
with tolerable calm. He was not conscious of guilt;
he had meant to do what he felt quite justifiable&mdash;rather
laudable than otherwise&mdash;to thrash a rascal
“within an inch of his life.” He had expected the
man to defend himself; he had been full of what he
felt to be righteous rage, and he did not feel himself
guilty now. He was haunted by no ghost; he had
ceased even to shudder at the recollection of the horrible
moment in which he became aware that instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of chastising he had killed. But when his momentary
occupation with other thoughts died away and the recollection
of what lay before him came back, the condition
of poor Jim was a dreadful one. To die&mdash;for
that!&mdash;to die on Thursday, the 3rd of September, at
a horrible moment fixed and unchangeable. To feel
the days running past remorselessly, swift, without an
event to break their monotonous flying pace&mdash;those
days which were so endlessly long from dawn to twilight,
which seemed as if they would never be done,
which had so little night, yet which flew noiselessly,
silently, bringing him ever nearer and nearer to the
end. Poor Jim broke down entirely under the pressure
of this intolerable certainty. Had it been done
at once, the moment the sentence had been pronounced;
but to sit and wait for it, look for it, anticipate
it, know that every hour was bringing it nearer,
that through the dark and through the day, and
through all the endless circles of thoughts that surmounted
and surrounded it, it was coming, always
coming, not to be escaped! Jim’s nerves broke down
under this intolerable thing that had to be borne.
He kept command of himself when he saw his mother
and sister, but with Dr. Barrère he let himself go.
It was a relief to him for the wretched moment. Save
for the moment, nothing, alas, could be a relief&mdash;for
whether he contrived to smile and subdue himself, or
whether he dashed himself against the wall of impossibility
that shut him in, whether he raved in anguish
or madness, or slept, or tried to put a brave face upon
it, it was coming all the time.</p>

<p>“It is sitting and waiting that is the horrible
thing,” he said; “to think there is nothing you can
do. That’s true, you know, doctor, in <i>Don Juan</i>,
about the people that plunged into the sea to get
drowned a little sooner and be done with it&mdash;in the
shipwreck, you know. It’s waiting and seeing it coming
that is horrible. It is just thirteen days to-day.
Death isn’t what I mind! it’s waiting for it. Will it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
be&mdash;will it be very&mdash;horrible, do you think&mdash;at the
moment&mdash;when it comes?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Dr. Barrère, “if it comes to that, not
horrible at all&mdash;a moment, no more.”</p>

<p>“A moment&mdash;but you can’t tell till you try what
may be in a moment. I don’t mind, doctor; something
sharp and soon would be a sort of relief. It is
the sitting and waiting, counting the days, seeing it
coming&mdash;always coming. Nobody has a right to torture
a fellow like that&mdash;let them take him and hang
him as the lynchers do, straight off.” Then Jim was
seized with a slight convulsive shudder. “And then
the afterwards, doctor? for all your science you can’t
tell anything about that. Perhaps you don’t believe
in it at all. I do.”</p>

<p>Dr. Barrère made no reply. He was not quite clear
about what he believed; and he had nothing to say
on such a subject to this young man standing upon
the verge, with all the uncertainties and possibilities
of life still so warm in him, and yet so near the one
unalterable certainty. After a minute Jim resumed.</p>

<p>“I do,” he said firmly. “I’ve never been what you
call a skeptic. I don’t believe men are: they only pretend,
or perhaps think so, till it comes upon them.
I wonder what they’ll say to a poor fellow <i>up there</i>,
doctor? I’ve always been told they understand up
there&mdash;there can’t be injustice done like here. And
I’ve always been a true believer. I’ve never been led
away&mdash;like that.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a subject on which I can talk,” said the
doctor, unsteadily; “your mother and Agnes, they
know. But, Jim, for the love of God don’t talk to
them as you are doing now. Put on a good face for
their sakes.”</p>

<p>“Poor mother!” said Jim. He turned all at once
almost to crying&mdash;softened entirely out of his wild
talk. “What has she done to have a thing like this
happen to her? She is a real good woman&mdash;and to
have a son hanged, good Lord!” Again he shivered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
convulsively. “She won’t live long, that’s one thing;
and perhaps it’ll be explained to her satisfaction up
there. But that’s what I call unjust, Barrère, to torture
a poor soul like that, that has never done anything
but good all her life. You’ll take care of Agnes.
But mother will not live long, poor dear. Poor dear!”
he repeated with a tremulous smile. “I suppose she
had a happy life till I grew up&mdash;till I&mdash;I wonder
what I could be born for, a fellow like me, to be
hanged!” he cried with a sudden, sharp anguish in
which there was the laughter of misery and the groan
of despair.</p>

<p>Dr. Barrère left the prison with his heart bleeding;
but he did not abandon Jim. On the contrary, there
was a terrible attraction which drew him to the presence
of the unfortunate young man. The doctor of
Poolborough jail, though not so high in the profession
as himself, was one of Dr. Barrère’s acquaintances,
and to him he went when he left the condemned cell.
The doctor told his professional brother that Surtees
was in a very bad state of health. “His nerves have
broken down entirely. His heart&mdash;haven’t you remarked?&mdash;his
heart is in such a state that he might
go at any moment.”</p>

<p>“Dear me,” said the other, “he has never complained
that I know of. And a very good thing, too,
Barrère; you don’t mean to say that you would regret
it if anything did happen, before&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No,” said the doctor, “but the poor fellow may
suffer. I wonder if you’d let me have the charge of
him, Maxwell? I know you’re a busy man. And it
would please his mother to think that I was looking
after him. What do you say?”</p>

<p>The one medical man looked at the other. Doctor
Barrère was pale, but he did not shrink from the look
turned upon him. “I’ll tell you what I’ll do, Barrère,”
said the prison doctor at last. “I’m getting
all wrong for want of a little rest. Feel my hand&mdash;my
nerves are as much shaken as Surtees’! If you’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
take the whole for a fortnight, so that I may take my
holiday&mdash;”</p>

<p>Dr. Barrère thought for a moment. “A fortnight?
That will be till after&mdash;I don’t know how I’m to do
it with my practice; but I will do it, for the sake of&mdash;your
health, Maxwell: for I see you are in a bad
way.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” said the other, “a breath of air will
set me all right, and I shall be forever obliged to you,
Barrère.” Then he stopped for a moment and looked
keenly in his face. “You’re a better man than I am,
and know more: but for God’s sake, Barrère, no tricks&mdash;no
tricks. You know what I mean,” he said.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t know what you mean. I know you
want a holiday, and I want to take care of a case in
which I am interested. It suits us both. Let me have
all the details you can,” said Dr. Barrère.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dct.jpg" width="100" height="119" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi110">THE day had come, and almost the hour. The
weary time had stolen, endless, yet flying on
noiseless wings; an eternity of featureless lingering
hours, yet speeding, speeding towards that one
fixed end. And there was no reprieve. The important
people of Poolborough had retired sullenly from their
endeavours. To support a Government faithfully and
yet not to have one poor favour granted&mdash;their recommendation
to mercy turned back upon themselves;
they were indignant, and in that grievance they forgot
the original cause of it. Still there were one or
two still toiling on. But the morning of the fatal day
had dawned and nothing had come.</p>

<p>To tell how Mrs. Surtees and Agnes had lived
through these days is beyond our power. They did
not live; they dragged through a feverish dream from
one time of seeing him to another, unconscious what
passed in the meantime, except when some messenger
would come to their door, and a wild blaze and frenzy
of hope would light up in their miserable hearts: for
it always seemed to them that it must be the reprieve
which was coming, though each said to herself that it
would not, could not, come. And when they saw Jim,
that one actual recurring point in their lives was perhaps
more miserable than the intervals. For to see
him, and to know that the hour was coming ever
nearer and nearer when he must die; to sit with him,
never free from inspection, never out of hearing of
some compulsory spectator; to see the tension of his
nerves, the strain of intolerable expectation in him&mdash;was
almost more than flesh and blood could bear.
They had privileges which were not allowed in ordinary
cases&mdash;for were not they still ranked among the
best people of Poolborough, though beaten down by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
horrible calamity? What could they say to him? Not
even the religious exhortations, the prayers which
came from other lips less trembling. They were dumb.
“Dear Jim,” and “God bless you,” was all they could
say. Their misery was too great, there was no utterance
in it; a word would have overthrown the enforced
and awful calm. And neither could he speak.
When he had said “Mother,” and kissed her, and
smiled, that was all. Then they sat silent holding
each other’s hands.</p>

<p>Through all this Dr. Barrère was the only human
supporter of the miserable family. He had promised
to stand by Jim, to the end, not to leave him till life
had left him&mdash;till all was over. And now the supreme
moment had nearly come. The doctor was as pale,
almost paler than he who was about to die. There
was an air about him of sternness, almost of desperation;
yet to Jim he was tender as his mother. He had
warned the authorities what he feared, that agitation
and excitement might even yet rob the law of its victim.
He had been allowed to be with the condemned
man from earliest dawn of the fatal morning in consequence
of the warning he had given, but it appeared
to the attendants that Jim himself bore a less alarming
air than the doctor, whose colourless face and
haggard eyes looked as if he had not slept for a week.
Jim, poor Jim, had summoned all his courage for this
supreme moment. There was a sweetness in his look
that added to its youthfulness. He looked like a boy:
his long imprisonment and the enforced self-denial
there was in it, had chased from his face all stains of
evil. He was pale and worn with his confinement and
with the interval of awful waiting, but his eyes were
clear as a child’s&mdash;pathetic, tender, with a wistful
smile in them, as though the arrival of the fatal hour
had brought relief. The old clergyman who had baptised
him had come, too, to stand by him to the last,
and he could scarcely speak for tears. But Jim was
calm, and smiled; if any bit of blue sky was in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
cell of the condemned, with all its grim and melancholy
memories, it was in Jim’s face.</p>

<p>The doctor moved about him not able to keep still,
with that look of desperation, listening for every
sound. But all was still except the broken voice of
the old clergyman, who had knelt down and was praying.
One of the attendants too had gone down on
his knees. The other stood watching, yet distracted
by a pity which even his hardened faculties could not
resist. Jim sat with his hands clasped, his eyes for
a moment closed, the smile still quivering about his
mouth. In this stillness of intense feeling all observation
save that of the ever-watchful doctor was momentarily
subdued. Suddenly Jim’s head seemed to
droop forward on his breast; the doctor came in front
of him with one swift step, and through the sound of
the praying called imperatively, sharply, for wine,
wine! The warder who was standing rushed to fill it
out, while Dr. Barrère bent over the fainting youth.
It all passed in a moment, before the half-said sentence
of the prayer was completed. The clergyman’s
voice wavered, stopped&mdash;and then resumed again, finishing
the phrase, notwithstanding the stir and hurried
movement, the momentary breathless scuffle,
which a sudden attack of illness, a fit or faint, always
occasions. Then a sharp sound broke the stillness&mdash;the
crash of the wine glass which the doctor let fall
from his hand after forcing the contents, as it seemed,
down the patient’s throat. The old clergyman on his
knees still, paused and opening his eyes gazed at the
strange scene, not awakening to the seriousness of it,
or perceiving any new element introduced into the
solemnity of the situation for some minutes, yet gazing
with tragic eyes, since nothing in the first place
could well be more tragic. The little stir, the scuffle
of the moving feet, the two men in motion about the
still figure in the chair, lasted for a little longer; then
the warder uttered a stifled cry. The clergyman on
his knees, his heart still in his prayer for the dying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
felt it half profane to break off into words to men in
the midst of those he was addressing to God&mdash;but
forced by this strange break cried, “What is it?&mdash;what
has happened?” in spite of himself.</p>

<p>There was no immediate answer. The doctor gave
some brief, quick directions, and with the help of the
warder lifted the helpless figure, all fallen upon itself
like a ruined house, with difficulty to the bed. The
limp, long, helpless limbs, the entire immobility and
deadness of the form struck with a strange chill to the
heart of the man who had been interceding wrapt in
another atmosphere than that of earth. The clergyman
got up from his knees, coming back with a keen
and awful sense of his humanity. “Has he&mdash;fainted?”
he asked with a gasp.</p>

<p>Once more a dead pause, a stillness in which the
four men heard their hearts beating; then the doctor
said, with a strange brevity and solemnity, “Better
than that&mdash;he is dead.”</p>

<p>Dead! They gathered round and gazed in a consternation
beyond words. The young face, scarcely
paler than it had been a moment since, the eyes half
shut, the lips fallen apart with that awful opening
which is made by the exit of the last breath, lay back
upon the wretched pillow in all that abstraction and
incalculable distance which comes with the first touch
of death. No one could look at that, and be in any
doubt. The warders stood by dazed with horror and
dismay, as if they had let their prisoner escape. Was
it their fault? Would they be blamed for it? They
had seen men go to the scaffold before with little feeling,
but they had never seen one die of the horror of
it, as Jim had died.</p>

<p>While they were thus standing a sound of measured
steps was heard without. The door was opened with
that harsh turning of the key which in other circumstances
would have sounded like the trumpet of doom,
but which now woke no tremor, scarcely any concern.
It was the sheriff and his grim procession coming for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the prisoner. They streamed in and gathered astonished
about the bed. Dr. Barrère turned from where
he stood at the head, with a face which was like ashes&mdash;pallid,
stern, the nostrils dilating, the throat held
high. He made a solemn gesture with his hand towards
the bed. “You come too late,” he said.</p>

<p>The men had come in almost silently, in the excitement
of the moment swelling the sombre circle to a
little crowd. They thronged upon each other and
looked at him, lying there on the miserable prison bed,
in the light of the horrible grated windows, all awe-stricken
in a kind of grey consternation not knowing
how to believe it; for it was a thing unparalleled that
one who was condemned should thus give his executioner
the slip. The whisper of the sheriff’s low voice
inquiring into the catastrophe broke the impression a
little. “How did it happen&mdash;how was it? Dead! But
it seems impossible. Are you sure, doctor, it is not a
faint?”</p>

<p>The doctor waved his hand almost scornfully towards
the still and rigid form. “I foresaw it always;
it is&mdash;as I thought it would be,” he said.</p>

<p>“His poor mother!” said the clergyman with a
sort of habitual, conventional lamentation, as if it
could matter to that poor mother! Dr. Barrère turned
upon him quickly. “Go to them&mdash;tell them&mdash;it will
save them something,” he said with sudden eagerness.
“You can do no more here.”</p>

<p>“It seems impossible,” the sheriff repeated, turning
again to the bed. “Is there a glass to be had?&mdash;anything&mdash;hold
it to his lips! Do something, doctor.
Have you tried all means? are you sure?” He had
no doubt; but astonishment, and the novelty of the
situation, suggested questions which really required
no answer. He touched the dead hand and shuddered.
“It is extraordinary, most extraordinary,” he said.</p>

<p>“I warned you of the possibility from the beginning,”
said Dr. Barrère; “his heart was very weak.
It is astonishing rather that he bore the strain so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
long.” Then he added with that stern look, “It is
better that it should be so.”</p>

<p>The words were scarcely out of his lips when a sudden
commotion was heard as of some one hurrying
along the stony passages, a sound of voices and hasty
steps. The door which, in view of the fatal ceremonial
about to take place, had been left open, was pushed
quickly, loudly to the wall, and an important personage,
the Mayor of Poolborough, flushed and full of
excitement, hurried in. “Thank God,” he cried, wiping
his forehead, “thank God, it’s come in time! I
knew they could not refuse us. Here is the reprieve
come at last.”</p>

<p>A cry, a murmur rose into the air from all the
watchers. Who could help it? The reprieve&mdash;at such
a moment! This solemn mockery was more than human
nerves could bear. The warder who had been
poor Jim’s chief guardian broke forth into a sudden
loud outburst, like a child’s, of crying. The sheriff
could not speak. He pointed silently to the bed.</p>

<p>But of all the bystanders none was moved like Dr.
Barrère. He fell backward as if he had received a
blow, and gazed at the mayor speechless, his under
lip dropping, his face livid, heavy drops coming out
upon his brow. It was not till he was appealed to in
the sudden explanations that followed that the doctor
came to himself. When he was addressed he seemed
to wake as from a dream, and answered with difficulty;
his lips parched, his throat dry, making convulsive
efforts to moisten his tongue, and enunciate
the necessary words. “Heart disease&mdash;feared all the
time&mdash;” he said, as if he had partly lost that faculty
of speech. The mayor looked sharply at him, as if
suspecting something. What was it? intoxication?
So early, and at such a time? But Dr. Barrère seemed
to have lost all interest in what was proceeding. He
cared nothing for their looks. He cared for nothing
in the world. “I’m of no further use here,” he said
huskily, and went toward the door as if he were blind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
pushing against one and another. When he had
reached the door, however, he turned back. “The
poor fellow,” he said, “the poor&mdash;victim was to be
given to his family after&mdash;. It was a favour granted
them. The removal was to be seen to&mdash;to-night; there
is no reason for departing from that arrangement, I
suppose?”</p>

<p>The officials looked at each other, not knowing what
to say, feeling that in the unexpected catastrophe
there was something which demanded a change, yet
unable on the spur of the moment to think what it
was. Then the mayor replied faltering, “I suppose
so. It need not make any change, do you think? The
poor family&mdash;have enough to bear without, vexing
them with alterations. Since there can be&mdash;no doubt&mdash;”
He paused and looked, and shuddered. No
doubt, oh, no doubt! The execution would have been
conducted with far less sensation. It was strange
that such a shivering of horror should overwhelm
them to see him lying so still upon that bed.</p>

<p>“Now I must go&mdash;to my rounds,” the doctor said.
He went out, buttoning up his coat to his throat, as
if he were shivering too, though it was a genial September
morning, soft and warm. He went out from
the dark prison walls into the sunshine like a man
dazed, passing the horrible preparations on his way,
the coffin! from which he shrank as if it had been a
monster. Dr. Barrère’s countenance was like that of
a dead man. He walked straight before him as if he
were going somewhere; but he went upon no rounds;
his patients waited for him vainly. He walked and
walked till fatigue of the body produced a general
stupor, aiding and completing the strange collapse of
the mind, and then mechanically, but not till it was
evening, he went home. His housekeeper, full of anxious
questions, was silenced by the look of his face,
and had his dinner placed hastily and silently upon
the table, thinking the agitation of the day had been
too much for him. Dr. Barrère neither ate nor drank,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
but he fell into a heavy and troubled sleep at the
table, where he had seated himself mechanically. It
was late when he woke, and dark, and for a moment
there was a pause of bewilderment and confusion in
his mind. Then he rose, went to his desk and took
some money out of it, and his cheque-book. He took
up an overcoat as he went through the hall. He did
not so much as hear the servant’s timid question as
to when he should return. When he should return!</p>

<p>After the body of poor Jim had been brought back
to his mother’s house and all was silent there, in that
profound hush after an expected calamity which is
almost a relief, Agnes, not able to rest, wondering in
her misery why all that day her lover had not come
near them, had not sent any communication, but for
the first time had abandoned them in their sorrow,
stood for a moment by the window in the hall to look
if, by any possibility, he might still be coming. He
might have been detained by some pressing call. He
had neglected everything for Jim; he might now be
compelled to make up for it&mdash;who could tell? Some
reason there must be for his desertion. As she went
to the window, which was on a level with the street,
it gave her a shock beyond expression to see a pallid
face close to it looking in&mdash;a miserable face, haggard,
with eyes that were bloodshot and red, while everything
else was the colour of clay&mdash;the colour of death.
It was with difficulty she restrained a scream. She
opened the window softly and said:</p>

<p>“Arnold! you have come at last!” The figure outside
shrank and withdrew, then said, “Do not touch
me&mdash;don’t look at me. I did it: to save him the
shame&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Arnold, come in, for God’s sake! Don’t speak so&mdash;Arnold&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never, never more! I thought the reprieve would
not come. I did it. Oh, never, never more!”</p>

<p>“Arnold!” she cried, stretching out her hands. But
he was gone. Opening the door as quickly as her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
trembling would let her, the poor girl looked out into
the dark street, into the night: but there was no one
there.</p>

<p>Was it a dream, a vision, an illusion of exhausted
nature, unable to discern reality from imagination?
No one ever knew; but from that night Dr. Barrère
was never seen more in Poolborough, nor did any of
those who had known him hear of him again. He
disappeared as if he had never been. And if that was
the terrible explanation of it, or if the sudden shock
had maddened him, or if it was really he that Agnes
saw, no one can tell. But it was the last that was ever
heard or seen of Dr. Barrère.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dci.jpg" width="100" height="118" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi080">IT WAS in that pleasant season of the year
when there is a ladder at every apple-tree, and
every man met on the road is driving with his
left hand and eating a red apple from his right. At
this season, as regularly as the year rolled round, old
Carshena Hubblestone nearly died of cramps, caused
by gorging himself with apples that fell almost into
his mouth from the spreading boughs of fruit trees
that fairly roofed his low-built house. This was, as
it were, Carshena’s one dissipation. The apples cost
him nothing, and his medical attention after his bouts
cost him nothing either, for he was the son of a physician,
and though his father was long since dead, the
village doctor would not render a bill.</p>

<p>“Crow don’t eat crow,” Dr. Michel answered,
roughly, when Carshena weakly asked him what he
owed. The chance of thus roistering so cheaply is not
presented to every man, and reluctance to let such a
bargain pass was perhaps what helped to lend periodicity
to the old man’s attacks. Dr. Michel always held
that this was his chief incentive, and, be this as it
might, it was very certain that apples and bargains
were the only two things on earth for which Carshena
was ever known to show a weakness, creditable
or discreditable. Most small communities have their
rich men and their mean men, but in the village of
Leonard the two were one.</p>

<p>As the years passed on and Carshena’s head whitened,
it naturally grew to be a less and less easy task
for Dr. Michel to bring his patient back to the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
where he had been before apples ripened. If the situation
had not tickled a spice of humor that lay under
the physician’s grim exterior he would have refused
these autumnal attentions. As it was he confined
himself to futile warnings and threats of non-attendance,
but he always did obey the summons when it
came. The townsfolk of Leonard would all have taken
the same humorous view of this weakness of Carshena’s
but for the trouble which it gave his too-good
sister Adelia&mdash;liked and pitied by every one. Adelia
nursed her brother in each attack with a tenderness
and anxiety that aggravated all the community. Nobody
but his sister Adelia was ever anxious over Carshena.
It was, therefore, like a bolt from a clear sky
when, in this chronicled autumn, the following conversation
took place at the Hubblestones’ gate. Dr.
Michel’s buggy was wheeling out to the main road as
Mr. Gowan, the town butcher, was about to drive
through the gateway.</p>

<p>“Well, doctor,” called the genial man of blood, a
broad grin on his round face, “how’s the patient?”</p>

<p>“He’s gone, sir,” said Dr. Michel, drawing rein.
The butcher drew up his horse sharply, his ruddy face
changing so suddenly that the doctor laughed outright.</p>

<p>“Gone!” echoed Mr. Gowan. “Not gone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, as I warned him time and again he would
go.”</p>

<p>The butcher shook his head and pursed his lips, the
news slowly penetrating his mind. “Well, I certainly
would hate to die of eatin’ apples,” he said at last.</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll find you hate to die of anything,
when the time comes,” said the more experienced physician.
“Carshena,” he added, “got nothing he didn’t
bring on himself, if that’s any comfort to him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak hard of the dead, doctor,” he urged.
“We’ve all got to follow him some day. He wasn’t
a nice man in some ways, Carshena wasn’t, but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He was a nasty old man in most ways,” snapped
the doctor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t say such things now, doctor, don’t,” urged
his companion. “Ain’t he paid in his full price, whatever
his sins was? Poor soul! he can’t be worse’n
dead.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he can, and for one I believe he is,” interrupted
the doctor. His crisp white hair seemed to
Mr. Gowan to curl tighter over his head as he frowned
with some thought he was nursing. “You haven’t
seen the will I had to witness this morning!” he burst
out. “Just you wait a little! Upon my soul! the
more I think of it the madder I get! It’s out of my
bailiwick, but if I were a lawyer I’d walk right up
now under those old apple-trees yonder, and before
that man was cold on his bed I’d have his sister’s
promise to break his old will into a thousand splinters!
Wait till you hear it. Good-morning.”</p>

<p>When the will was read and its contents announced,
the town of Leonard, including its butcher, took the
doctor’s view to a man.</p>

<p>“A brute,” said Dr. Michel, hotly, “who has let his
old sister work her hands to the bone for him, and then
turned her off like some old worn-out horse, has, in
my opinion, no right to a will at all. How about setting
this will aside in his sister’s interests, judge?”</p>

<p>A little convocation of the leading spirits of Leonard
were met together in Dr. Michel’s office to discuss the
matter of Carshena’s will, and what should be done
with Adelia, cast on the charity of the village. Judge
Bowles, when appealed to, raised his mild blue eyes
and looked around the company.</p>

<p>“Adelia,” he said, “is the best sister I ever knew.
Had the man no shame?”</p>

<p>“Shame!” said the town’s barber, with a reminiscent
chuckle; “why, he came into my parlors one day
and asked me if I’d cut the back of his hair for twelve
cents, and let him cut the front himself; and I did it,
for the joke of the thing! He saved thirteen cents
that way.”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, gentlemen!” demurred the judge; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
amid the general laughter the tax-gatherer’s voice
rose:</p>

<p>“There isn’t a tax he didn’t fight. This town got
nothing out of Carshena Hubblestone that he could
help paying; and now he leaves us his relatives to
support.”</p>

<p>Judge Bowles rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” he said, in mild but earnest rebuke,
“the man is dead. We all know what his character
was without these distressing particulars. It is entirely
true that we owe him nothing, but a dead man
is defenceless, and his will is his will, and law is law.
Did you ever think what a solemn title a man’s last
will is? It means just what it says, gentlemen&mdash;his
last will, his last wish and power of disposition writ
down on paper, concerning his own property. It’s a
solemn thing to break that.”</p>

<p>“A man’s no business having such a will and a disposition
to write it down on paper,” said the doctor.
“What were the exact terms of the will, judge?”</p>

<p>“Very simple,” said Judge Bowles, dryly. “The
whole estate is to be sold, and the entire proceeds,
every cent realized, except what is kept back for repairs
and care, is to be applied to the purchase of a
suitable lot and the raising of a great monument over
the mortal remains of Carshena Hubblestone.”</p>

<p>“While his sister starves!” added Dr. Michel.</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed the kindly butcher. He had
heard all this before, but thus repeated it seemed to
strike him anew, as somehow it did all the rest of the
company. They sat looking at each other in silence,
with indrawings of the breath and compression of lips.</p>

<p>“There is this extenuating circumstance,” said the
doctor, with dangerous smoothness; “our lamented
brother was aware that unless he erected a monument
to himself he might never enjoy one. We&mdash;the judge,
Mr. Gowan, and myself&mdash;are made sole executors
under the will&mdash;without pay. In Carshena’s life
Adelia was his white slave. In his death, doubtless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
he felt he could trust her to make no protest. I wish
you could have seen her with him as I have, gentlemen.
I shall call it a shame upon us if we let her eat
the bitter bread of our charity. She’s been put upon
and trodden down, but she’s still a proud woman in
her way, and we’ve got to save her from a bitter old
age. We’ve got to do it.”</p>

<p>“It’s the kind of thing that discourages one’s belief
in humanity,” said the judge, in a lowered tone. “This
affair might be only absurd if it weren’t for the sister’s
share in it. As it is, it’s a revelation of human
selfishness that makes one heart-sick.”</p>

<p>Dr. Michel’s laugh rang out irreverently.</p>

<p>“It’s perfectly absurd, sister or no sister,” he said.
“Nobody, not one of us, loved Carshena in life&mdash;though
I think now we didn’t hate him half enough&mdash;and
here in death he’s fixed it so the town’s got to
pay for his responsibilities while his money builds
him a grand monument! I call that about as absurd
as you’ll get anywhere. I’ll grant you it makes me
downright sick at my stomach, judge, but it don’t
touch my heart. No, sir. Keep your organs separate,
as I do, gentlemen. There’s one thing certain”&mdash;he
drew the eyes of his audience with uplifted finger&mdash;”if
we can’t outwit this will somehow, we’ll be the
laughing-stock of this whole county. I don’t care a
snap of my finger if Carshena has a monument as high
as Haman’s gallows, if only his sister is protected at
the same time.”</p>

<p>“Well, short of breaking the will, what would you
suggest, doctor?” asked Judge Bowles, with a little
stiffness. He had not liked the familiar discourse on
his organs, but the doctor did not care. The judge
was ruffled at last, which was exactly what he desired.</p>

<p>“Suggest?” he cried, laughing. “I don’t know;
but I know there never was a will written that couldn’t
be driven through with a coach and six if the right
man sits on the box. You’re the lawyer, judge.”</p>

<p>The judge was a lawyer, as he then and there proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
to prove. He rose to his feet and spoke in his
old-fashioned style:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, I think I speak for this company when
I say that we strongly object to the breaking of this
will as a bad precedent in the community. We wish
it carried out to the very letter. Our fellow-townsman
knew his sister’s needs better than we, and he
chose to leave her needy. There are many, many
things this town sorely wants, as he also knew, but he
chose to use his money otherwise. What a monument
to him it would have been had he built us the new
school-house our town requires! The wet south lot
down by the old mill is an eyesore to the village.
Had he used that land and drained it and set up a
school-house there, or indeed any public building,
what a different meeting this would have been! He
was our only man of wealth, and he leaves not so much
as a town clock to thank him for. No; a monument
to <i>himself</i> is what his will calls for, and a monument
he shall have. If we failed him here, which of us
would feel sure that our own wills would be carried
out? In the confidence of these four walls we can say
that the difficulties of the inscription and the style of
monument seem insuperable. I know but one man to
whom I would intrust this delicate commission. I
feel confident that he would not render us too absurd
by too conspicuous a monument or too florid an inscription.
Need I name Dr. Michel?”</p>

<p>“Out of my bailiwick,” cried the doctor&mdash;”’way
out of my bailiwick.” But his voice was drowned
in the confusion of the popular acclaim that was forming
him into a committee of one. The kindly butcher
made his way to the doctor’s side under cover of the
noise.</p>

<p>“Take it, doctor; now do take it,” he whispered
in his ear. “There ain’t a man in the town that can
shave this pig if you can’t. I was sayin’ just yesterday
you’re lost in this little place of ourn. You’ve
got more sense than’s often called for here. Here’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the chance for you to show ‘em what you can do. Do
take it.”</p>

<p>The physician looked at the wheedling little butcher
with a glance from his blue eye that was half kindly,
half irritated. “Well, I’ll take it,” he cried; “I’ll
take it; and I thank you for your confidence, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>It was a full month before the little company met
again in the doctor’s office, but during that period
they knew Dr. Michel had not been idle in the matter
intrusted to his care. He was seen in close conversation
with the town’s first masons, the best carpenters,
the local architect, and these worthies, under close and
eager examination, gave answers that dashed the unspoken
hopes of those who questioned. Here were
<i>bona fide</i> bids asked for on so much masonry, so much
carpentering, and the architect had been ordered to
send in designs of monuments, how high he deemed it
unprofessional to state; but arguing inversely, they
judged by the length of his countenance that the measurements
were not short&mdash;he had particularly hated
Carshena. It was, for all these reasons, a rather anxious-looking
company that met in Dr. Michel’s office
at his summons, and the doctor’s own face was not reassuring
as he opened the meeting.</p>

<p>“Well, gentlemen,” he said, slowly, “it’s a thankless
task you’ve given me, but such as it is, I hope you
will find I have performed it to your satisfaction.
Here are various plans for the monument to be erected
to our late fellow-citizen, and here is a plan of the
ground that it has seemed to me most suitable to purchase.
It has been a task peculiarly uncongenial to
me, because I, I suppose, know more than any of you
here how this money is needed where it ought to have
gone. I saw Adelia yesterday, and lonely and ghost-ridden
as that old house would be to any of us, it’s a
home to her that’s to be sold over her head to build
this.” He laid his hand on the papers he had thrown
down on the table before him. The little company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
looked silently at each other, with faces as downcast
as if they were to blame. It was Judge Bowles who
spoke first.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” he said, “we must not let ourselves
feel too responsible in this matter. We are only following
our plain duty. Show us the monument which
you consider best, doctor.”</p>

<p>The doctor was silently turning over the papers.
“Family feeling is a queer thing,” he said, meditatively.
“I saw Adelia the other day, and I asked her
if she wanted a neighbor to sleep in the house at night.</p>

<p>“’There’s nothing here for robbers to take, Dr.
Michel,’ she said; ‘and if it’s ghosts you think I’m
afraid of, I only wish from my heart ghosts would
come back to visit me. Everybody of my blood is
dead.’”</p>

<p>“It’s very pitiful,” said Judge Bowles, slowly.</p>

<p>The doctor turned on him instantly. “Do you seem
to feel now that you could countenance breaking the
will, judge?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the judge, shortly, as one who whistles
to keep his courage up.</p>

<p>The doctor’s fingers drummed on the table as he
paused thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Carshena,” he said, “if you can believe me, measured
out the kerosene oil he allowed for each week on
Monday; and when it gave out they went to bed at
dusk, if it gave out on Friday night. But one thing
Adelia did manage to do. So long as a drop of oil was
in the measure a light stood in a window that lit up
the ugly turn in the county road round the corner
of their house. I know her light saved me from a bad
collision once; some of you also, perhaps. She’s kept
that little lamp so clean it always shone like a jewel
up there. The window-pane it shone through had
never a speck on it either. That’s what I call public
spirit. And it’s public spirit, too, that makes her keep
sweet-smelling flowers growing on the top of the old
road wall. In summer I always drive past there slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
to enjoy them. When she comes on the charity of the
town she may console herself by remembering these
things. She did what she could (in spite of Carshena),
and nobody can do more. Here are the plans
for his monument, gentlemen. I would like to have
your vote on them.”</p>

<p>The little company, as if glad to move, drew about
the table as the doctor opened out the plans in a row.
The butcher, whose ruddy face looked dim in his disappointment,
and whose despondent chin hung down
on his white shirt bosom, picked up one of the designs
gingerly and examined it.</p>

<p>“Are they all alike, doctor?” he asked.</p>

<p>Judge Bowles looked over Mr. Gowan’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Each design seems to be a hollow shaft of some
kind, with a round opening at the top,” he said, and
looked inquiringly over his glasses at the doctor, who
nodded assent.</p>

<p>“They are all hollow. You seem to get more for
your money so. The round opening at the top of the
shaft can be filled with anything we choose later. I
might suggest a crystal with the virtues of the deceased
inscribed on it. Then, if we keep a light burning
behind the glass at night, those virtues will shine
before us by night and by day.”</p>

<p>Judge Bowles lifted his eyes quickly. The doctor’s
face was unpleasantly satiric, and his blue eyes looked
out angrily from under his curling white hair. Judge
Bowles sat down, leaning back heavily in his chair,
his perplexed eyes still on Dr. Michel’s frowning
brow. Mr. Gowan, with a look as near anger as he
could achieve, moved to a seat behind the stove. His
idol was failing him utterly. He felt he himself could
have done better than this. Dr. Michel’s roving eyes
glanced round the circle of dissatisfied and dismayed
faces, and then for the first time he seemed to break
from his indifference:</p>

<p>“This is all very well, gentlemen&mdash;very well indeed.
The facts are, you gave me a commission, and bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
me to fulfill it strictly and to the letter, and now you
are dissatisfied because I have followed your wishes.
What did you expect? If you had left the matter
to me without restrictions, I should certainly have
tried to break the will, as I told you. Briefly, here is
my report. We shall have about twenty thousand
dollars all told to invest in a monument over our
lamented brother. Any one of these hollow masonry
structures here will cost about ten thousand dollars.
As to the purchase of a suitable lot, which the will directs,
I think even Carshena would declare it a good
bargain to pay nothing whatever for the land, and
that I can arrange, I believe. I have good reason to
suppose”&mdash;he began to speak very slowly&mdash;”that the
town would, without price, allow us to erect this monument
on that unsightly bit of wet land to the south,
near the old mill, if we in turn will agree to drain the
grounds, keep them in good order, plant flowers and
shrubbery, and further promise to keep a light burning
all night in an opening at the top of the monument.
I spoke of a crystal set in that opening, with
the virtues of the deceased inscribed upon it, but we
can, if we choose, carve those same virtues in the more
imperishable stone below, and print something else&mdash;a
clock face perhaps&mdash;on the crystal above. That’s a
mere minor detail.”</p>

<p>Judge Bowles, whose gaze had been growing more
and more bewildered, now started in his chair and sat
suddenly upright. He stared at the doctor uncertainly.
The doctor cast a quick look at him, and went
on rapidly:</p>

<p>“If you will allow me, I’ll make my report quickly,
and leave it with you. I have a great deal to do this
morning in other directions. It has occurred to me
that as the base of the monument is to be square and
hollow, it would be easy to fit it into a comfortable living-room,
with one, or perhaps two, small rooms built
about it. I have not mentioned this to the architect,
but I know it can be done. The will especially directs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
that repairs and care be allowed for.” The doctor
was talking rapidly now. “The monument will not
cost more than ten thousand, the clock about two.
Twelve thousand from twenty thousand leaves eight
thousand. The yearly interest on eight thousand and
the fact that we could offer free residence in the monument
should let us engage a reliable resident keeper,
who would give the time and attention that such a
monument and such a park would need.”</p>

<p>The doctor paused, and again looked about him.</p>

<p>The whole circle of faces looked back at him curiously&mdash;some
with a puzzled gaze, but several, including
Judge Bowles, with a half-fascinated, half-dismayed
air. Mr. Gowan alone preserved his look of
utter hopelessness.</p>

<p>“Who’d take a job like that?” he said, gloomily.
“I wouldn’t, for one, live in a vault with Carshena,
dead or alive.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the grave could be outside, and the monument
as a kind of monster head-stone,” said the doctor
pleasantly. “My idea was to have the grave well outside.
Four or five hundred and a home isn’t much
to offer a man, gentlemen, but I happen to know a very
respectable elderly woman who would, it seems to me,
suit us exactly as well as a man. In fact, I think it
would considerably add to the picturesque features
of our little town park to have a resident female
keeper. I think I see her now, sitting in the summer
sunshine at the door of this unique head-stone monument,
or in winter independently luxuriating in its
warm and hospitable shelter. I see her winding the
clock, affectionately keeping the grave like a gorgeous
flower-bed, caring for the shrubbery, burnishing the
clock lamp till it shines like a jewel, as she well knows
how to do, and best of all in her case, gentlemen, I
happen to know from her own lips that she has no
fear of ghosts. Why, gentlemen, what’s the matter?
I protest, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>At that moment Mr. Gowan might be said to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
doctor’s only audience. The rest of the company were
engaged in whispering to each other, or speechlessly
giving themselves over to suppressed and unholy glee.
Judge Bowles was openly wiping his eyes and shaking
in his chair. Dr. Michel looked around the circle with
resentful surprise.</p>

<p>“You seem amused, gentlemen!” he said, with dignity;
and then addressing himself to Mr. Gowan exclusively,
as if that gentleman alone were worthy to be
his listener, “Would you object to a woman as keeper,
Mr. Gowan?”</p>

<p>“What’s her name?” asked the butcher.</p>

<p>A roar of laughter, not to be long suppressed,
drowned his words. Mr. Gowan looked about the
shaken circle, stared for a moment, then suddenly, as
comprehension, like a breaking dawn, spread over his
round face, he brought his hand down hard on his fat
knee.</p>

<p>“Well, doctor,” he roared, in admiration too deep
for laughter, “if you ain’t the dawgornest!”</p>

<p>The doctor’s wiry hair seemed to rise and spread
as wings, his eyes snapped and twinkled, his mouth
puckered. “Will some one embody this in the form
of a motion?” he asked, gravely. The judge dried
his eyes, and, with difficulty, rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” he said, “I move that we build this
monument with a base large enough for a suite of
rooms inside; that we set this structure on the lot
which our good doctor has chosen; that we ornament
it with an illuminated clock at the top; and further,
that&mdash;that this female keeper be appointed.”</p>

<p>“Seconded, by Harry!” roared Mr. Gowan.</p>

<p>The doctor, with his hands on his hips, his body
thrown far back, looked with the eye of a conqueror
over the assembly. “Those in favor of the motion
will please say Aye; those opposed No. It seems to
be carried! it is carried,” he recited in one rapid
breath.</p>

<p>“Amen!” endorsed Mr. Gowan, fervently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>And this warm approval of their butcher was in the
end echoed as cordially by the most pious citizens of
Leonard. After the first shock of their surprise was
over, natural misgivings were lost in enjoyment of
the grim humor of this very practical jest of their
good doctor’s, that visitors now actually stop over a
train to see. Many a village has its park, and many
a one its illuminated clock; it was left for Leonard
to have in its park a grave kept like a gorgeous flower-bed,
and at the grave’s head a towering monument
that is at once a tombstone, an illuminated clock and
a residence.</p>

<p>Who the next keeper may be it is one of the amusements
of Leonard to imagine. The present keeper is
a happy old woman, whose fellow-citizens like nothing
better than to see her winding the clock, caring for
the flowers, burnishing the town lamp; in summer
sitting in the sunshine at the door of the head-stone
monument, in winter luxuriating in that warm and
independent shelter.</p>

<p>“I feel as if Carshena knew just what was best for
me, after all, doctor,” she said to her physician, in
his first call upon her in her new home; and that
worthy, with a nod of his white head, assented in
the readiest manner.</p>

<p>“Doubtless, madam, doubtless,” he said, “Carshena
had all this in mind when he made me his executor.
Didn’t you, Carshena?” He winked his eye genially
at the grave as he passed out, and with no shade of
uncertainty or repentance in his mind, climbed into
his buggy and went on his satisfied way.</p>

<h2 class="p2">DOCTOR ARMSTRONG.</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dcc.jpg" width="100" height="119" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi120">COLVIN ARMSTRONG tried to take up his pen
with an air of happiness and relief, for it was
the last chapter of his great work which he
was about to commence. But the effort failed, and he
leaned back in his chair, thoroughly tired out&mdash;too
jaded to be brisk or energetic.</p>

<p>It was not his professional work that tired him. A
London surgeon, with a magnificent reputation, he
had more than enough to do; but he was only forty,
and his constitution was of iron. Work agreed with
him: it was Thought that utterly prostrated him at
times. No sooner was his last engagement fulfilled, or
his last patient despatched, than he retired to his
library and gave himself up to the great psychological
problem that racked his brains. Night brought a
short relief: he slept from twelve till six; but morning
renewed his wrestlings, and it was only the necessity
of attending to his surgery that freed him from the
incessant train of thought. Would that his head were
as cool as his strong, firm hands!</p>

<p>It was the Mystery of Human Pain that was haunting
him. Until two years back he had never given
such questions a thought, but then the problem began
to force itself upon him. How was it that so many
suffered a living martyrdom, whilst he himself never
knew a moment’s pain? How was it that, having no
personal knowledge of pain, he nevertheless felt such
an overpowering sympathy with those who suffered,
and had such an instinctive inborn gift of giving relief?
And then the larger, less personal questions:
Was there any guiding hand allotting pain to innocent
mortals? Were they really innocent? If there
was design in it all, from whom came the design, and
what was its purpose? Was it for good, or evil, or
both? If no Providence guided humanity, what was
the origin of pain? Why was it allowed to be? And
so on, in an endless train of thought, one problem suggesting
ten others, till the subject broadened out to
the doors of Eternity itself, and the mind reeled before
its own imaginings.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="i174" id="i174">i174</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc"><span class="smcap red"><i>Vaccinating the Baby</i></span></p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Armstrong flew to his books for assistance, and
primed himself with the ideas of the metaphysicians;
but he was not satisfied, and a strong impulse led him
to try his own hand at solving the mystery. Gradually,
after much hard reading and thinking, he
evolved a theory which, though far from satisfactory,
seemed ampler and better than the ideas of the old
philosophers; and then, slowly and laboriously, he
committed it to paper. As the work grew, he became
more convinced of the truth which seemed to lurk
in his views, the foundation of real discovery on
which his theses were based. Something of his marvellous
insight into disease and distortion seemed to
have entered into the book, and he was eager to give it
to the world.</p>

<p>So this was the last chapter! By Jove! how hot and
close the room was! It was annoying to feel so dull
and listless, but there was some excuse: nine o’clock
at night is not a time when a man is at his freshest,
and there was nothing so wearing as this closely woven
intellectual work, where every thread had to be followed
to its end, every detail thought out, every possible
ramification explored, and the mind kept at its
highest tension throughout, straining to cover the
whole ground and to order in logical sequence its
myriad elusive thoughts. Difficult? Why, there was
nothing to compare to it! But what was the good of
magnifying troubles? Here was the final chapter, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
conclusion which was to be so masterly, already
mapped out in his mind, only waiting to be transferred
to paper. Armstrong wiped his damp forehead,
and seized the pen. The room was lit as he liked
it, with only a lamp casting a subdued light on his
desk; the rest in deepest gloom. Now was the time
to begin. But he was terribly tired.</p>

<p class="pc large" style="letter-spacing: 1.5em;">*********</p>

<p>Kr-rk!</p>

<p>Armstrong leaned back in his chair, and pressed
his hand to his head. Something inside seemed to
have broken with a snap, or a tiny shutter had fallen
away, as in a camera, revealing a hidden lens in his
brain. His head was clearer and freer, as if some
clogging veil had suddenly been removed, and before
his eyes there burned a new light, steady and cold,
but brilliant. A cooler, purer air filled the room. The
present melted away from his vision.<span class="mid" style="letter-spacing: 0.8em;"> * * * * *</span></p>

<p>Far away&mdash;so far that everything was dwarfed, but
yet as distinct in every detail as though it had been
close at hand&mdash;Armstrong saw a vision.</p>

<p>A dark underground dungeon, with damp standing
in beads on its bare stone walls; a man, bound, gagged,
and helpless; another, black-masked and sullen of
movement; a third, seated on a small platform, with
his face in shadow. A feeble hanging lamp, swaying
to and fro in the draughts of the cell, was the only
illumination.</p>

<p>The vision came nearer and nearer, and grew larger
as it came, until it reached Armstrong and filled his
room, and he felt the dank breath of the dungeon stir
his hair. He looked again: the masked man was at his
elbow, the man on the dais was above him&mdash;unrecognisable
in the shadow, but smiling gently; that much
he could see. Then he looked at the third man, the
prisoner; and a thrill of dread went through him, for
he recognised himself,&mdash;in old-world, long-forgotten
garb, but still himself. And then the whole grew real,
with a deadly reality; he was no more a mere spectator,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
but a part of the vision, and the vision was a
part of his own existence. The chill of the room fell
on his spirit, filling him with vague, horrible forebodings:
the present mingled with the past, and his spirit
passed into the limp, helpless figure on the rack. He&mdash;he
himself, and none other&mdash;was the victim in the
torture chamber, and the world was black around
him.</p>

<p>There was a clank of steel on the floor, as though
little instruments had been dropped, and then a sudden
sharp pang struck him from an unseen source.
Another, another, and yet another,&mdash;a very multitude
of keen stabbing pangs. In uncontrollable agony he
raised his voice to shout with pain, but the gag
stopped him, choked him, throttled his curses. And
the dark figure smiled from above.</p>

<p>Then came hot, burning, throbbing pains that shot
through him, turning the blood in his veins to fire,
and gnawing his vitals till they consumed away. He
tried to turn, to roll, to ease himself in any way; but
he was bound and rigid and helpless, and his efforts
only increased the torture. And still the figure sat
motionless above him. He turned his streaming eyes
upwards in mute appeal, and his answer was a smile.</p>

<p>Then the sharp pains and the burning misery ceased
for a while, and his aching limbs rested, and all
seemed over. But the presiding fiend waved a silent
signal, and worse came&mdash;stretching, straining torture,
that nearly pulled the wretched frame asunder (well
if it had!), and dull grinding agonies, worse than
the sharper pains, more cruel and relentless than the
stabs or blows or thrusts.</p>

<p>And then the worst of all&mdash;the whole in combination.
Crushing, grinding, distorting, straining, breaking,
bending, blinding, burning, flaying, racking,
stabbing&mdash;more than the mind can picture or words
describe&mdash;in turn and together, and all the more horrible,
coming unseen and sudden and unawares.
Crush and rack and burn and grind, till the brain was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
on fire and the body groaning under its burdens; till
the face was furrowed with tears of agony, the whole
frame shapeless and broken, limbs useless, muscles
tortured, twisted and crushed, nerves shattered, and
the spirit within flaming with miserable, hopeless hate.
Madness? No; that had come in the first silent moments
of fear and pain, but the cruel hand had driven
it away, and now there was only PAIN&mdash;deep, unfathomable
Pain.</p>

<p>Then came a low whisper, the cool breath of Death
waiting softly outside the chamber, and the wounded
soul fluttered for a moment in joyous answer. But
the human fiend above knew it, and the torture
stopped. Sore, blistered, broken, and useless, he was
flung aside to endure still longer in his misery, and
Death turned sighing away.</p>

<p class="pc large" style="letter-spacing: 1.5em;">*********</p>

<p>Armstrong sprang from his chair with curses on
his tongue and fury in his heart, and grasped convulsively
at the retreating vision. But it was far, far
off, and melting slowly into air.</p>

<p>Then a great calm fell upon him, and he knew what
he had seen. It was a scene from a former life&mdash;his
last existence&mdash;and it was vouchsafed to him as a lesson,
a glimpse of the everlasting order of life. The
inspiration of a great Message glowed on his brow
and in his soul. And this was the Message which he
read, clear as the words of a seer:&mdash;</p>

<p>“For inasmuch as thou hast suffered pain and bitterness
of spirit in the past, so shalt thou now know
freedom from such; and to thee it shall be given, by
thy past sufferings, to discern and make lighter the
grievous burdens of thy fellow-men. And the pain
that thou hast felt in thy veins shall give thee understanding
above all others, that thou mayest cure man’s
infirmities and heal the sick of his house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The light of a great revelation dazzled Armstrong
for a while, but he rose from it with renewed strength
and hope and courage, resolved to devote himself more
than ever to the healing art. And first he destroyed
his manuscript, for his theories were shattered and
forgotten. The mystery of human pain was still unsolved;
but was it for him to solve it? Providence
had given him another mission,&mdash;to heal and cure.
And Providence had given him the clue to one mystery,
at all events&mdash;his own great sympathy with sufferers
and insight into suffering. Sometimes he wondered
whether another revelation would follow; but
none came, and he pursued his usual career, doing
good and working hard. The idle speculations, the
restless quest of secret things, which had haunted him
and wearied him before, were now of the past, and he
lived for work alone.</p>

<p>But more was to come&mdash;unexpectedly and without
warning.</p>

<p>It was an ordinary case he was treating: brain surgery.
The man, a wretched creature, suffered severely,
and was in a broken state of health; Armstrong
had traced it to brain pressure, and saw his
way easily to put things right by a cerebral operation.
He was just concluding an examination, and the patient
lay quietly in the great chair, soothed by a slight
injection of morphia. Armstrong turned away to get
a light&mdash;it was five o’clock on an autumn day, just
beginning to grow dark&mdash;when suddenly there came
that strange grating “Kr-rk” in his head, and he felt
the room whirl around him. He clutched hard at a
table near him, but it receded from his grasp and he
felt himself falling down, down, down in giddy helplessness.
Then the movement stopped, and he felt, as
before, that some weight had been lifted from his
brain, and a new, unused sense developed in him. But
this time there was no clear light, no pure air, no
vision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>What was coming? Something, he felt, was in
store&mdash;some strange, new revelation&mdash;and he waited
eagerly. As the prophets of old were inspired, so
light had come to him, and now perhaps he would
learn one more secret of the troubled world.</p>

<p>But nothing came; all was blank darkness around
him, and an uneasy sense of foreboding stole slowly
over him, till his hand shook and his face grew damp
with cold sweat.</p>

<p>What was that? A far-off mocking laugh? And
<span style="letter-spacing: 0.5em;"> * * *</span> O God in heaven! Not <i>that</i> again! Not
<i>that</i>!</p>

<p>He tried to call again, for pangs worse than of
death were racking him; but something cold was
thrust into his mouth and choked him. And then his
eyes, shut tight in the clenched agony of pain, opened
again, and he saw the streaming dungeon walls, the
swaying lamp, the masked torturer, and the grim
shadow-figure seated motionless on the dais above
him; and his heart sank within him, and he turned
sick and faint.</p>

<p>For one brief moment the masked man turned away&mdash;to
heat his irons, perhaps, or rest his arms, weary
of their heavy work&mdash;and all Armstrong’s spirit went
up in one short, agonised, burning prayer, in one
deep, strenuous remonstrance.</p>

<p>“I have felt it before,” he cried. “I have endured
it before, and I know its meaning. Must I go through
all again? Have I failed in my duty? Save me from
pain and madness before it is too late! O God of cruelty,
Pain-giver, merciless, wicked, infernal, save me,
save me, preserve me!”</p>

<p>His words, stifled by the gag, reached no human
ear; but in the cell a new presence was lurking, and
on his face fell a hot, quick breath.</p>

<p>A voice spoke in his ear, very soft and gentle and
low.</p>

<p>“You blaspheme in vain,” it said; “God has not
sent you this vision, but <i>I</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The torture was over, and Armstrong waited quietly
for the moment of restoration to the world; but
it did not come, and a new fear seized him. What if
he never recovered from this state? As the Powers
of Good had vouchsafed him the first vision, so the
Powers of Evil had mocked him with the second&mdash;the
same as the first, but infinitely more terrible, for
through the former a subtle strength of will had sustained
him, and he had emerged from it wiser, happier,
and stronger, whilst now he felt himself deserted
and unaided, and<span style="letter-spacing: 0.5em;"> * * *</span> Heavens above! What
would come next? The physical torture was over, but
now his mind was on the rack, and it was worse, far
worse!</p>

<p>The two grim figures remained in the cell, motionless
as statues. A strange detachment of mind, a
mystic duality of self, was torturing Armstrong.
Here he felt the pangs and achings of the most terrible
pain; yet at the same time he knew that it was
all unreal, and his thoughts turned to the world above&mdash;his
work, his house, his friends, the very patient in
his chair, waiting and wondering. Somewhere between
the two lay madness, and his spirit cried for
peace&mdash;a world all vision, or a world all reality&mdash;anything
but this perplexing, torturing union of the two.</p>

<p>Quick as thought came the answer. “Look around
before you go.”</p>

<p>It was the soft voice he had heard before&mdash;gentle,
but insistent. But he had seen too much of that hateful
cell, and he closed his eyes in tight resistance.</p>

<p>“Look around,” said the voice, even more gently
than before.</p>

<p>A shuddering fear seized Armstrong.</p>

<p>The spirit read his thoughts. “You are afraid:
you dare not look at <i>me</i>. But you shall not see me.
Look!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>He put his hand to his head and covered his eyes
with a convulsive movement.</p>

<p>“Listen!” said the voice. “You have not even seen
your enemy. Would you not know him?”</p>

<p>A cold sickness fell on Armstrong’s spirit, and he
shuddered. Why see the monster who had tortured
him, the human fiend who could be nothing other than
repulsive?</p>

<p>Then the voice spoke again, more gently than before.</p>

<p>“Listen! I am the God of Evil, but I befriend you.
I pass my hand along your frame, and the pain leaves
you. I touch your eyes with my fingers, and they
open. Look around!”</p>

<p>Armstrong rose, sound and strong. The dungeon
was dark, but in its recesses he could see two cowering
figures, striving to hide themselves from his eyes.
One was the masked man; one was the director, the
inquisitor, the author of all his misery.</p>

<p>“See how he hides from you,” whispered the voice.
“But you shall not be denied. <span class="smcap">Turn!</span>”</p>

<p>The sudden thunder of that last word echoed
through the vault, and then there came a short, sharp,
double flash of blinding light. The first flash showed
a crouching, cowering figure in the background, with
pale, set face, and cruel eyes; the second struck Armstrong
full in the face and felled him to the ground.</p>

<p class="pc large" style="letter-spacing: 1.5em;">*********</p>

<p>Dazed and frightened, as after a hideous nightmare,
he pulled himself together. The match he had taken
up was still in his hand, and he turned back, mastering
himself with a great effort, to his patient.</p>

<p>He lighted the big burner and turned it full on the
chair. The man, roused from the lethargy of morphia,
slowly opened his eyes.</p>

<p>Armstrong staggered back, stifling the cry of horror
that rose to his lips; for in that one glance he saw,
clear and unmistakable, the face of his torturer&mdash;reincarnated,
but still the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Armstrong turned aside to hide his excitement. After
all, then, the vision had not been in vain: it was the
complement of the first; and now all was clear. The
Mystery of Human Pain! His own great book on the
subject! He laughed aloud. All that thought and
time and labour had been wasted, and here was the
truth, shown to him in a dream&mdash;the truth that all the
world should know. A strange exaltation filled his
spirit.</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> suffered pain, and now I reap my reward&mdash;strong,
happy, a healer of wounds, myself knowing
no suffering. <i>He</i> inflicted pain and torture, and now
he suffers for it.”</p>

<p>The patient in the chair moved uneasily and
groaned. Armstrong went on: “A righteous Judge
rewards me for what I have undergone, and scourges
him for the evil he has wrought.”</p>

<p>“The Lord have Mercy on his Soul!”</p>

<p>It was a deep voice that spoke, the words booming
and reverberating like the notes of heavy bells. It
touched a new chord in Armstrong’s mind, and sent
the blood throbbing and pulsing through his head.
“The Lord have mercy on his soul!” Why? What
mercy had <i>he</i> had for others? And with that the fury
of hate returned to him and surged through his veins,
till he felt himself more demon than man. Every
pang, every pain, every racking agony that he had
suffered in those two terrible visions, returned to him
threefold, burned into his soul, branded on every limb
and sinew. Curse him with the curse of the martyr,
and blast him with the breath of his iniquities!</p>

<p>And then a cold, unnatural calm fell upon Armstrong,
and his quivering hands grew steady and cunning
as before.</p>

<p class="pc large" style="letter-spacing: 1.5em;">*********</p>

<p>It was all so easy! The man lay there, half conscious&mdash;with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
enough sensation left to feel every torture
inflicted on him, but yet unable to speak or groan.
It was a carefully managed anæsthetic, administered
just sufficiently to glaze the eyes and paralyze the
tongue, but no more. And the brain lay so near at
hand!</p>

<p>The mad fury of revenge had left Armstrong, and
he was cold, scientific and deliberate&mdash;no movement
hurried, no torment left untried, and all done with
the mechanical, even touch of the skilled workman.
A pang for a pang, a stab for a stab, a scald for a
scald; Armstrong remembered each pain he had endured,
and paid it back threefold. On the subtle
mechanism of the head he played as on a keyed instrument,
sending hot, shooting pains, and dull, numbing
clutches, to the remotest parts of the wretched frame.</p>

<p>All the poor worn nerves centered within his grasp,
and to his eyes they were visible throughout their
hidden course, coming to one common end, where he
grasped them as with a handle, and turned and
ground and twisted and crushed, till they stretched,
strained, groaned and quivered under his racking
touch. He hissed taunting words in his ears&mdash;words
that he knew could not be answered; he mocked at
the helpless agony. And all the while he watched the
blue lips, striving to curse and moan, but bound by
the hellish drug as with a gag; and the bloodshot,
straining eyes, too fixed even to appeal; and the dumb
agony of the whole wretched form. And a grim, silent
laughter shook him.</p>

<p>But it could not last forever: his hand wearied, and
his head reeled. He fell to the ground in a swoon.
<span style="letter-spacing: 0.5em;"> * * * </span></p>

<p>Bells were ringing&mdash;light, airy, joyous bells; and he
roused himself. The bells grew slower, fainter&mdash;died
out altogether&mdash;and in their place a voice was in his
ears, very soft and low. What was it saying? It was
so faint, so indistinct<span style="letter-spacing: 0.5em;"> * * * </span></p>

<p>“On <i>your</i> soul may the Lord have mercy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Armstrong rose as from a dream. In the chair lay
a shape, not mangled, indeed, but pale-faced,
shrunken, distorted, horrible. He bent his head down
and listened to the heart; there were two feeble beats,
a faint flicker, and then it stopped.</p>

<p>There was a strange catch in the surgeon’s breath.
The room was hot and close; he pushed the curtains
back, and looked out. It was night now&mdash;a deep blue
sky, studded with a myriad stars. And one star shot
upwards in a blaze of silver light.</p>

<p>Armstrong turned away, breathing heavily. There
was the body still, and there were the little instruments
he had used.</p>

<p>The present did not stir him, gave him no thought;
but the knowledge of the future was upon him, and
he groaned aloud in the new-born agony of his soul.
For he knew what he had done: it was his chance, and
he had missed it; it was his trial, his ordeal, and he
had failed<span style="letter-spacing: 0.5em;"> * * * </span>And in the next life on earth his
torture would be longer and harder to bear. The
Lord would have no mercy on his soul.</p>

<h2 class="p2">DR. WYGRAM’S SON.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dcw.jpg" width="100" height="120" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi">WHEN I met Dr. Clarence Wygram a few weeks
ago, I had not seen him for nearly fifteen
years. We were boys at school together, and
fast friends at that time, but our intercourse since
then has been very intermittent. Since he lost his
wife in Southern Italy, many years ago, much of his
life has been spent abroad, and, though he is to be seen
in London at intervals, I seldom catch a glimpse of
him. We do not belong to the same set in town, and
as, being possessed of an ample fortune, he has never
engaged in practice as a physician, his wandering and
unoccupied life is little akin to my own. We do, however,
meet occasionally by accident, when we talk over
old times, vow to see more of each other in the future,
and then part for&mdash;perhaps, other ten years. Such
acquaintanceships as this of Wygram and myself are
the most unsatisfactory of all&mdash;they can scarcely be
called friendships. Life, in my opinion, is too brief
for such unfrequent greetings. It is important, however,
that I recall, for a moment, this penultimate
meeting with my old friend. It happened long ago,
but the circumstances are still fresh in my memory.
As I have said, this was our last meeting but one,
and the date some fifteen years ago.</p>

<p>I was about to travel to the North by the night mail,
and accidentally stumbled against Dr. Wygram on the
crowded platform at Euston. He is always pleased
to be facetious, when we do chance to see each other,
in regard to our mutually altered appearance since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
our last meeting, and predicts, in jocular fashion, that,
ere long, we shall certainly pass without recognition
on either side. There is some truth in what he says,
yet, to judge by my friend’s careworn and haggard
appearance on this occasion, I should say he was aging
somewhat faster than myself.</p>

<p>It seemed that we were to be fellow-travellers. He
also was going north, though not so far as myself, and
I willingly shared a compartment, which he had
already secured for himself and his son, a stripling
youth, apparently about fourteen. The latter was returning
to school after the Easter Holidays, and his
father (who, by the way, is not above the Cockney
weakness of calling every big school a college) was
accompanying him on the journey. I remember that,
for the first hour or two, we had enough of conversation
to beguile the time. Wygram had, of course, been
abroad&mdash;I forget where, or for how long, but we were
quite agreed&mdash;we always are, on this point&mdash;to view
the simple fact of his absence as being a perfectly
sufficient and satisfactory explanation of the time that
has elapsed since our last meeting, however long that
interval may be. After that, our conversation began
to languish. Our old friendship notwithstanding, we
have really very little in common. Having spent a
somewhat fatiguing day, I felt disposed to doze, and I
believe that I ultimately slept.</p>

<p>When I awoke, with a start, we were travelling at
a high rate of speed. On the seat directly opposite
to mine reclined my young travelling companion, apparently
asleep, the lamplight falling full upon his
upturned face. He seemed to all appearance not very
robust; I think his father had hinted as much to me
on the platform before we started. The boy’s sleep
was a somewhat restless one, and he shifted his position
uneasily, as, ever and anon, the oscillation of the
carriage half aroused him. As, only half awake myself,
I sat drowsily watching him, I suddenly became
aware that his father, who was looking over some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
papers by the aid of a reading lamp at the farther
end of the compartment, seemed to wish, by a sign
that he made, that I should join him. The thought
struck me at the time, that perhaps he desired some
conversation with me while his son was not a listener.
I accordingly shifted my travelling rugs, and took a
seat opposite to that of my old friend.</p>

<p>The impression, on my part, that he did not wish the
boy to overhear what he said was partly confirmed
when my companion began the conversation in tones
so low as to be barely audible above the rattle of the
train. But I confess that I was somewhat unprepared
for the substance of his communication, even when
I did catch his meaning. At first, what he said was
almost unintelligible to me, but at length I contrived
to gather, from what he told me, that some trouble
(affliction, I think, was the word he used) had lately
overtaken him, and he seemed, though indirectly, to
appeal to me for sympathy under his trial. The appeal,
however, was entirely indirect, as no particulars
were afforded&mdash;at least, if they were, I failed to understand
their meaning. Under these circumstances,
I was about to inquire, as delicately as I could, what
the nature of his difficulty might be, when I chanced
to notice that, as he spoke, his eyes would every now
and then wander from looking in my face, and turn,
as it were unconsciously, in the direction of his boy,
not apprehensively, or as if he were afraid of him as
a listener, but gently and tenderly, as if in deep solicitude
on his account. This being the case, I forebore to
press the father with questions which might be considered
intrusive. The trouble to which he alluded
was perhaps connected with the lad’s future, perhaps
with something else concerning him, anyhow the secret,
whatever it was, seemed to lie in that, or in some other
equally delicate quarter, for Dr. Wygram did not give
me any explicit details&mdash;rather avoided doing so, with
a reticence quite unlike his customary frankness. But
he had a favour to ask of me. It came to that, in the
end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“You know,” he said appealingly, “you are my
oldest friend&mdash;almost my only friend now, for my
wandering life does not gain me new ones, and I beg
you, most earnestly, to aid me, to help me, in this
trouble&mdash;” Here he paused as if about to make some
disclosure, then, checking himself, “to counsel me,
when I ask you, at a future time.”</p>

<p>Of course, my somewhat pardonable curiosity had
no further excuse, but I murmured that I would be
very glad if, at any time, I could be of service to him.
I added that our old friendship justified such a claim
on his part, and that, for my own, I would gladly meet
it, when necessary. I confess I thought that the reserve
accompanying his request was somewhat singular.</p>

<p>“Ah, but promise! promise to me!” (he repeated
the word with such passionate emphasis as to startle
me); “promise that if I write you at any time and ask
you to come to my help, you will do it&mdash;wherever I
may be.”</p>

<p>This last clause of his request was a tolerably comprehensive
one, as, from the doctor’s well-known migratory
habits, the summons might possibly be indited
from Mongolia, or the farthest recesses of Crim-Tartary.
But to pacify him, for I saw that my old friend
was strangely perturbed, I said that I would do what
he wished, at any time, if I could; which latter clause
covered the aforesaid difficulty so far. He seemed
relieved by my assurance. His manner grew calmer.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you more just at present,” he said
(this with a glance at the boy), “except that I am in
sore trouble, from which, at another time, not now, the
counsel of a friend may relieve me. It concerns one
near and dear to me” (ah! then the secret did lie
there), “and you are the only one I could trust. Perhaps,
in time, my trouble may be dissipated” (this
with a hopeless, sickly smile), “and then you will be
glad I have not bored you with it, but if not, and if
I seek fulfilment of your promise, remember!” With
which words he abruptly broke off the conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Shortly afterwards my fellow-travellers reached
their destination. Dr. Wygram had, by this time,
completely recovered his vivacity. When wishing me
good-bye, a silent pressure of the hand, more prolonged
than usual, alone betrayed any recollection, on
his part, of our midnight conversation. I did not recover
my own equanimity so rapidly; the interview
came back upon me, as I sat alone for the rest of the
journey, somewhat too vividly for that. A nameless
uneasiness possessed me. I wearied myself with possible
explanations of Wygram’s alleged troubles. Money
difficulties were out of the question in the case of one
so well off as he, so simple and unostentatious in his
mode of life, and he would be the last man to gamble.
His son&mdash;pooh! The birch was the best cure for boyish
peccadilloes, and he would get that on going back
to school. Still, reason with myself as I might, Dr.
Wygram’s nameless trouble remained with me; the
boy’s sleeping face in the lamplight, the father’s
urgent entreaty “remember,” these did not pass away.
After all, I would reproach myself for having promised
to obey the summons of my friend whenever it
might come; how awkward that might be! Why could
not he, if so anxious for my counsel, arrange to come
to me? Altogether, it was not until several days had
elapsed that I shook off the disagreeable impression
left by the journey. As for Dr. Wygram’s possible
summons, I looked for that, more or less confidently,
for several months, then my expectation of its coming
began to fade. As a matter of fact, it did come after
all, but not for fifteen years. Then it came upon this
wise. I had been from home for some days. On returning,
a pile of letters awaited me. Sorting them
over one by one, the last in the heap was addressed
in an unmistakable handwriting. “Wygram’s summons
at last,” I said to myself, as the mist of the
years rolled away and I was once more travelling
northwards in the train; once more my friend’s voice
in my ear, “remember!” once more the lamplight on
his son’s sleeping face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Opening the letter, I read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pi4 p1">Low Tor Cottage, by Liskeard, Cornwall,</p>
<p class="pi8">Sept. 3, 188&mdash;.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">Dear F.:&mdash;Remember promise given long ago. Pray
come as soon as possible!</p>

<p class="pr4">Thine</p>
<p class="pr2"><span class="smcap">Clarence Wygram</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">In the circumstances, what could I do but make arrangements,
as speedily as I could, to keep my promise?
Within twenty-four hours I was on my way to
Cornwall.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dca.jpg" width="100" height="119" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi">A GIG awaited my arrival at the nearest railway
station, and a short drive brought me to Low
Tor Cottage. Dr. Wygram met me at the
door. Considering the lapse of years since our last
interview, I was, of course, prepared to find my friend
looking much older; but I was scarcely prepared to
see him so utterly feeble-looking and broken, alike,
apparently, with age and sorrow, as when he greeted
me in the doorway. He bade me welcome in hurried
nervous tones; evidently he laboured under the influence
of suppressed emotion. We entered the sitting-room:
the dinner-table was set for two persons only.
He apologized for his secluded quarters, and the humble
arrangements of his household. “I have only been
here for a month or two,” he explained, “since my
return from the Continent.” A staid, elderly maid-servant
here entered the room. It was, of course, too
early for any confidential talk between my host and
myself; and, as the servant waited upon us during
dinner, anything but commonplaces were out of the
question. I judged from what I saw, however, that
Dr. Wygram was living alone; perhaps it was better
so. Our intercourse would be the more unrestrained.</p>

<p>Somehow, I do not know how it happened, I was the
first to break the ice, upon the question of the object
of my visit. And this prematurely, in fact within
half an hour of my arrival. Now I had mentally
cautioned myself, on the way down, against precipitate
allusions to the purpose of my coming; yet, as it
chanced, I stumbled upon the delicate topic, unawares,
before the servant had left us to our wine. It was,
then, on his son’s account that Dr. Wygram sought
my presence here. As much I gathered from his silence,
sudden and pained, when I made the remark.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Of course after this, and until we were alone together,
I turned the conversation into other channels, in what
I fear must have seemed a very clumsy fashion. My
host grew more and more absent and distrait. When
at length we drew our chairs near the fire, for the
autumn evenings were growing chilly, he had not
opened his lips for some minutes. I was quite unprepared
for what was to come. No sooner were we
alone, than, in his attempt to speak, he burst into
tears. It was long before he regained his composure.
At first all he could utter was a renewal of his thanks
to me for coming to see him in his loneliness&mdash;his
worse than lonely life, as he termed it.</p>

<p>I could make nothing of all this, but I endeavoured
to assure him of my earnest desire to help him, if only
he would frankly confide in me as his friend. It was
pitiful to see how, even after this invitation, it pained
him to make any avowal. He sank into a reverie for
a few moments, then, quickly rising to his feet and
laying a hand on my shoulder, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I will show you my sorrow, my friend, rather than
speak of it myself. What I show you will speak for
itself, for all words are vain.”</p>

<p>So saying, he motioned me to follow him, and led
the way from the room, carrying with him a small
shaded lamp.</p>

<p>When we entered an adjoining apartment the shadows
there were so dense, and the light we had with
us was so feeble, that, for some moments, I could discern
nothing. A dull fire smouldered in the grate,
but shed no light on the interior of the room, which
seemed furnished as a small parlour. There was a
large sofa at the farther end, and someone lay upon
it covered with rugs. Dr. Wygram held the light a
little lower, the rays fell upon an upturned face, that
of a boy apparently asleep. I started, for was it not
the self-same face upon which the flickering light of
a railway carriage lamp had fallen so many years before?
The very same, in every lineament, nothing
was changed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>I am not naturally quick in coming to a conclusion.
Things dawn upon me now even more slowly than of
old. I was startled for the moment, nothing more;
though a creeping horror moved already towards my
heart, I had not felt its actual touch.</p>

<p>“That is my sorrow,” said the father, turning to
me, without diverting the rays of the lamp from his
son’s face; then, without another word, motioned me
to follow him out. I did so. The shadows fell once
more upon the sleeper, even as the shadows of the
years had fallen, till that moment, upon my recollection
of his features.</p>

<p>On a sudden the full significance of what I had seen
rushed upon me.</p>

<p>“Great God!” I cried, “what is this, Wygram?
Speak!”</p>

<p>We were in the corridor now, and he did not return
an answer. We re-entered the lighted room. My patience
gave way.</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake,” I said, “Wygram, tell me
what is the meaning of this! How is your son&mdash;the
boy sleeping yonder&mdash;the same, unchanged&mdash;?” The
query died upon my lips, for he to whom I spoke was
pale as ashes. I read the answer of my inarticulate
question, there and then, in his face. By virtue of
some nightmare spell, the boy I had seen so many years
before, the boy, who by this time should have been a
grown man, was slumbering, <i>still a boy</i>, in the room
we had just quitted.</p>

<p>They say that when, in dreams, anything manifestly
absurd or inconsistent presents itself, the dreamer at
once awakes. In the sitting-room of the cottage that
night, seated beside my old friend, how often did I
think myself dreaming, and long for the moment of
waking to be precipitated by the seeming contradiction
I had just witnessed! For some time neither of
us spoke. Dr. Wygram sat motionless with the blank
and, as it were, featureless expression on his countenance
which I have so often seen sudden calamity impart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Yet his affliction, new and inexplicable to me
as yet, must have become familiar enough to himself.
After all, it must have been its first, its only revelation
to another, which, as it were, reawakened himself to
a sense of its utter bewilderment and hopelessness.
And to me (of all men) he had turned for help, for
counsel, in circumstances so astounding! What could
I do? My own brain was in a whirl. The sense of
wonderment once past, a painful search for possible
explanation succeeded&mdash;explanation of what? That
was the puzzling difficulty. A problem was before me,
but, from lack of all precedent, the conditions of effectual
presentation were wanting. How, then, attempt
the solution?</p>

<p>It must have arisen, I suppose, from the mental confusion
under which I laboured that I can give no very
lucid account of what immediately followed. I cannot
tell at what period of the evening the silent current
of our several thoughts flowed into a stream of
conversation. But I reproduce here the substance of
Dr. Wygram’s narrative, in his own words, as far as
possible, omitting some details not germane to the narrative.</p>

<p>“My son,” commenced Dr. Wygram, “inherited
his mother’s malady, that which in her case proved
fatal, pulmonary consumption. The unmistakable
symptoms developed themselves in him at an early age.
All the so-called remedies had been tried without avail.
Humanly speaking, my boy was doomed, my house
was apparently to be left unto me desolate. At first
I was in despair, a despair lightened to me at last,
however, by a gleam of hope. You are aware that I
have devoted my life to the study rather than the practice
of medicine. Being untrammelled with regular
avocations, I have been enabled to explore, more fully
than many of my professional brethren, what may be
called the by-paths of study&mdash;those less explored
tracks which are open to the medical scientist who is,
by training, a chemist as well. The practice of scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
medicine, among us in this country, at all events,
is in its infancy, although many, whose interest it is
to conceal the fact, will assure you to the contrary.
If any proof were needed of my assertion, the lame
and halting methods in use at the present day would
suffice. The insufferable greed for money so shamelessly
manifested renders the modern practitioner only
a better-class charlatan. Their failures are so gross,
their expedients to conceal these failures so unblushing,
that I have long recommended an adoption by the
public of the Chinese system. The far-seeing Celestials
only pay their medical adviser when they are
perfectly well. When they fall sick his pay stops till
he can restore them to health.</p>

<p>“But there is a second, and a higher path, known
only to a few, and these enthusiasts, careless of the
rewards of the crowd. It is but a dim and perilous
way at the best&mdash;it is easier to deride those who attempt
to traverse it than to follow them. The herd of
the profession eschew it for the most part. Present-day
materialists will have nothing, accept nothing,
which cannot be seen, tasted, handled, brayed in a
mortar, fitting fate for themselves as purblind fools!
See how reluctantly, how incredulously, the results of
even such a coarsely unmistakable remedy as electricity
are received by the profession. Yet electrical energy,
in medicine, is a clumsy weapon compared with
others in the armoury of transcendentalism. There
are blades infinitely keener for the expert&mdash;viewless
brands, wielded by few&mdash;the peerless Excalibur itself,
known to still fewer&mdash;for its point of a truth turneth
every way, to guard the path to the Tree of Life.”
Here he shuddered, but after a pause went on: “These
higher methods have their risks, their inseparable dangers.
Remember that experiment must at last be
made upon the living, human, subject. Demonstration
upon a score of tortured puppies will not avail.
Is <i>it</i> a wonder that the crude experimentalist, great at
the torture trough, and brave in <i>its</i> cruelties, recoils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
when the higher issue is at stake? But as I said, my
boy was doomed, save, as I hoped, in the last resort
of transcendentalism. That last resort I tried, but not
until numberless trials in the laboratory had convinced
me that my method must avail. I had discounted
every possibility of failure. So long did I delay that
the lamp of life had almost, with him, burned to the
socket. But I was wary; I knew well that the step I was
about to take was an irrevocable one, and my chief
anxiety was to prevent a possible miscarriage of consequences.
My plan, in short, promised to secure for one,
already within sight of death’s portal, a lease of life
prolonged&mdash;by how many months or years I could not
tell&mdash;that question lay in darkness, but at least prolonged
beyond what I could reasonably expect considering
his condition. A growth of new vital force&mdash;which
yet was not a growth&mdash;everything pointed the
other way, let me say a stock, was to be grafted into
the decaying and wasting organism, permanent in its
character, constant, without flux or reflux. But (ah!
that but which mars all that blooms and hopes!), like
all gifts added from without, unlike all properties
resident within, it, the gift, had an imperfection, a
strange, deadly, and irremediable fault. It grew not,
progressed not, aged not (do not start!); and this, its
thrice-accursed property, was so malignantly, so devilishly
potent, beyond hope of elimination or reduction,
that it subdued unto itself whatsoever it touched
or joined. Life preserved under its influence would
be preserved, not in activity but as it were in arrestment,
in default of needed repair, or rather with a subtle
supply and repair of its own so elusive as to evade
detection.</p>

<p>“Thus,” continued Dr. Wygram&mdash;”thus, with all
my caution, I erred&mdash;erred as all do, misled by some
devil’s wile, who work against the gods. Fool that I
was, my own caution deceived me, and that lying
legend of him who sought for immortality, but forgot
the advent of old age. But it is past now; others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
would have slipped on that insuperable threshold
where I fell. I exulted in the thought that my boy
would drink of the water of life and so defy the killing
years&mdash;but I forgot that <i>he was not yet a man</i>&mdash;knew
not that I was condemning him to a life of immaturity.
Hurry misled me at the last. Before I knew
it, he was almost gone&mdash;then I took the irrevocable
step. It was well that I worked in secret. No eye
but mine saw him as (oh, wondrous change!) he rose
from his sick-bed with an assured gift of life in every
limb and pulse, so sudden and startling that I dreaded
the coming of life’s angel almost as much as I had the
advent of him of death. For a time, I say, I would
almost, unknowing, have undone that which had been
done&mdash;but that stage passed, and I only watched and
waited.”</p>

<p>Dr. Wygram paused. Was it fancy that as he did
so I thought I heard a light footstep in the room above
us? The speaker did not seem to notice it, but went
on:&mdash;</p>

<p>“For a time I knew no fear, that I had erred I did
not know, as yet. For months he advanced in growth
towards manhood. Then the spell began to work its
hellish will. As he was then, as he is now, so will he
ever be. A blight fell upon him, a chill mildew rained
itself upon the issues of his life. A true death in life
is his, for life hasteth to fruition and then falls; but
this existence, with which I have dowered him, continues
changeless, dateless, ageless, as the years of the
Everlasting. I tell thee,” screamed the father, as he
sprang to his feet in a frenzy of uncontrollable horror&mdash;”I
tell thee my boy will never die!”</p>

<p>Overmastered by the contagion of his excitement, I
too had risen from my seat. As we faced each other
in silence, a breathing murmur rose on the air, formless
at first, then died away. Again a hushed murmur,
then a crash of chords from an instrument in the
room above. He of whom we spoke was playing
Chopin’s “Marche Funèbre.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dci.jpg" width="100" height="118" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi080">I NEED not enter into the details of my stay
at Low Tor Cottage, even if I were able to reproduce
them with correctness. My residence
there was, to me, a prolonged nightmare, with all hope
of an awakening denied me. Dr. Wygram had so
completely surrendered himself to despair as to be incapable
of making any effort. It would have been a
positive relief to myself had I been able to have considered
him insane, and the mystery before me a delusion
springing from that cause. But that conclusion
was shut out most effectually by my own personal
testimony (of which he always eagerly availed himself)
as to his son’s identity, and his practically unaltered
condition after an interval of so many years.
I had every opportunity of assuring myself on this
point. Young Wygram, though shy and backward,
preferring to mope in solitude, was our companion
after a day or two. But he never seemed wholly at
ease, would not join in any sustained conversation, and
had an apathetic listlessness about him which was positively
repellent. It was vain to try to arouse either
father or son from the overwhelming depression into
which both had apparently sunk. Some melancholy
drives we took together in a pony phaeton through
the solitudes of West Cornwall did not enliven us
much. It is a haunted land at its best, with its rolling
moorlands, and its mystic Dosmery Pool, fabled as
ebbing and flowing in its silent depths in sympathy
with the tides of the distant sea. As day after day
slipped away, I began to feel myself as partaking of
my friend’s hopelessness. Yet, if I hinted the uselessness
of continuing with him, he would become almost
frantic. As he pathetically repeated to me, I was his
only friend, the only one to whom he could confide his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
sorrows, so insupportable when borne alone. Gradually
he persuaded me, on one point, against my better
judgment. It was finally agreed between us that ere
I left some steps should be taken on his part to endeavour
to obtain a reversal, or part reversal rather,
of the conditions under which his son laboured (I use
the periphrasis as the plain words to me are unspeakably
painful), by something of the same methods by
which they had been compassed. The prospect to me
was very distasteful, indeed revolting, nor did Dr.
Wygram’s laboured explanations convey much information
to my non-professional mind. It is useless to
detail them here, they would be intelligible only to the
expert. But I could not deny him what he asked. I
fancy his wish was to secure some witness of his own
moral innocency, should any untoward accident happen.
I cannot blame him; indeed, I think he would
have been justified in taking almost any steps, short
of taking his son’s life, in the unparalleled circumstances
of the case.</p>

<p>And the time was short. That was another perplexity.
The constant state of nervous apprehension
which overcame Dr. Wygram whenever his residence
in one place lasted any time, pointed, of itself, to the
necessity of making haste. Perhaps he magnified this
difficulty; I cannot say. But there was something
about their retired life which seemed likely to invite
gossiping curiosity, in a country district more especially.
That the neighbours had already questioned
him as to the nature of his son’s <i>delicacy</i> he assured
me over and over again. What could they mean?
“He has been watched,” the father would say, excitedly.
“We have already been here too long. They notice
his unaltered appearance since our arrival. A
growing lad, such as he appears, would have made
some progress in the time, and they notice that he does
not&mdash;nor ever will,” he would add bitterly, “unless
my last efforts should prove successful.” It was idle
to try to reason him out of these fears&mdash;for all I knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
they might be real. It was pitiful to think how long
they had possessed him, during many weary years.
When I had met himself and his son fifteen years before,
they were, even then, travelling as fugitives from
place to place to avoid detection; still more harrowing
to think that, in the father’s case, from his rapidly
aging look and growing feebleness, these wanderings
must soon cease. Of his son’s fate, in that overwhelming
contingency, I could never trust myself to think.
The thought of it often overcame Dr. Wygram himself.
He told me once, that on one occasion, when
abroad, the terror of this self-same prospect so unmanned
him that he had attempted to confide in a
brother practitioner, an Englishman, resident, I think,
in Milan. “Like most countrymen of his craft
abroad,” said my poor friend bitterly, “he proved to
be utterly incredulous. I might have known it, before
exposing myself to his coarse ridicule. The line of
my studies has been so utterly outside the old groove
of pill and bolus, lancet and catheter, it is little wonder
that the crowd will have none of its results. This
professional brother only laughed in my face, rubbed
his hands in glee, as at a good joke, asking me if I
would not part with my recipe for a consideration,
seeing he had some half-dozen youngsters of his own
whose growing powers added to the tailor’s bill. English
medical men are proverbially obtuse, but for the
full development of their sheer obstinacy and mulishness
they should be transplanted to the soil which gave
birth to transcendentalism.”</p>

<p>It was a breathless autumn evening when, in my
presence, Dr. Wygram commenced his second experiment
with his son. The dim scent of the shrubberies
stole in through the open windows&mdash;over which the
blinds were drawn. On a couch in the centre of the
room lay young Wygram in a deep slumber, super-induced
by an opiate which his father had administered,
to aid the further stages of the treatment. A
brass chafing dish lay upon the floor, containing some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
smouldering embers; from a tripod upon the table
hung a small retort of crimson glass which glowed like
a ruddy gem in the flickering light of the spirit lamp
underneath.</p>

<p>With arms stripped bare to the elbows, Dr. Wygram
bent over his son, watching the depth of unconsciousness
in which the latter was immersed. For nearly an
hour my friend had not spoken a word. I did not
wish to interrupt him, but I saw by his manner at
length that the critical moment had arrived. He
turned to me at last, and in a broken whisper told me
that a few moments longer would decide his success
or failure. “We shall now, I trust,” he said, “have
insight granted us in regard to a hitherto hidden
mystery.”</p>

<p>I do not know whether he ever obtained the insight
in question, but I know that it was never granted to
me. For, at that moment, loud voices were heard in
the corridor. The door was unceremoniously thrown
open, and three men entered the room. Their leader,
a puffy, red-faced individual, fixed me with his glittering
eye from the moment of his coming into the room.
“That is the man!” he said, to his subordinates,
pointing, at the same time, to me as I stood irresolute.</p>

<p>A sudden panic possessed me that instant. To escape
by the door was impossible, as the men stood
beside it, but the window behind me was handy. I
turned, lifted the blind, and precipitately jumped into
the garden a few feet below. I do not believe that I
ever ran so fast in my life as I did on that occasion
through the mazes of the shrubbery. My one frantic
desire was to get away at all hazards from that dreadful
dwelling, though from what I fled I could not have
told. I only knew that horror, the accumulated horror,
of the past weeks, compressed into the moment,
possessed me to my very heels. A wretched dog
prowling about the garden gave chase to me as I fled,
under the impression that I was making off with some
portable property belonging to the establishment; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
I soon left him far behind, and I do not think that the
men joined in the pursuit, beyond the limits of the
cottage, if, indeed, they followed me at all. In my
terror I never looked behind, but ran through fields,
hedges, and ditches till I arrived, breathless and hatless,
at the nearest railway station. The officials
seemed somewhat surprised at the appearance I presented,
but I got a ticket without question, and was
soon seated in a railway carriage on my way to
London.</p>

<p class="pc large" style="letter-spacing: 1.5em;">*********</p>

<p>These memoranda, written after a long period of
nervous prostration, must be published, if for my own
exculpation alone. Shortly after their committal to
paper, a longing curiosity impelled me to inquire as
to the fate of my old friend. I had promised not to
desert him, and that promise I had scarcely kept. At
all hazards, then, I resolved to go to Cornwall once
more, even if by doing so, I should fall into the hands
of the authorities, as I doubted not he had done. At
all events, my own innocency was beyond question.</p>

<p>On the Paddington platform my apprehensions in
this latter respect were redoubled. A young man
standing beside me, when I was taking out my ticket,
certainly eyed me very narrowly.</p>

<p>“One of the minions of the law,” I said to myself;
“the affair has got wind after all.” As I was about
to take my seat he came forward and asked if he had
the pleasure of addressing Mr. F&mdash;&mdash; of Blank Street.
Resolved to brazen it out to the last, I admitted my
identity.</p>

<p>“You are acquainted with Dr. Wygram, I think?”
he continued, interrogatively.</p>

<p>I owned that I was. Denial, at this stage, would
have been useless.</p>

<p>“I am his son,” he said smilingly.</p>

<p>“His son!” I gasped. Then, after all, Dr.
Wygram’s second experiment had succeeded, and he
who was before me had been freed from the spell of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
his youth. Yes, there was no doubt of it! He was
now a man! “Is it possible?” I repeated, gazing at
him with astonishment.</p>

<p>“I think there is no doubt of it,” he replied coolly.
“You will be sorry to learn that my father is far from
well,” he resumed. “I have been from home for a
long time, but am just going down to see him, in Cornwall.”</p>

<p>“Just going down to see him?” This was mystery
upon mystery.</p>

<p>“My dear sir,” I said in despair, “I am very sorry
indeed to hear of your father’s illness, but would you
kindly answer me one question as distinctly as you
can. If you are Dr. Wygram’s son, how is it that
you do not remember me?”</p>

<p>“I do now most distinctly,” he replied. “I remember
travelling with you and my father, many
years ago, when I was going to school in the North.”</p>

<p>Heavens! Then all the years, since then, had been
a blank to him!</p>

<p>“Have you no recollection,” I suggested, “of having
been with your father since then, a short time ago,
in Cornwall?”</p>

<p>“Ah! that is my brother,” he quickly returned.
“Yes, <i>he</i> was with my father, when he took ill&mdash;been
with him too long, in fact, for the good of either. My
father, I am sorry to say, has for some time been quite
unhinged mentally.”</p>

<p>I should think he has, was my inward comment, for
I saw it all in a moment. There were two young
Wygrams; both of these I had seen when they were
youngsters of the same age. Why had I not thought
of this before? Is it not my special weakness that
things dawn upon me very slowly? The rest, of
course, was Dr. Wygram’s delusion, ultimately necessitating
his being placed under the care of his friends.</p>

<p>“My dear sir,” I replied, after a pause, and with
some effusion of manner, “I sincerely trust that your
father’s distressing illness may be but temporary. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
his being able to receive the message, kindly present
him with my warmest regards. Meanwhile, one question
more before we part, for I am not going by this
train; I&mdash;I have changed my mind. How many years,
may I ask, may there be between your own age and
that of your brother?”</p>

<p>“About fourteen or fifteen,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Quite so; and when you were youngsters of about
the same age, say, were you not considered very like
one another?”</p>

<p>“Remarkably so,” he answered, laughingly, “as like
as two peas.”</p>

<h2 class="p2">ON THE INDIA FRONTIER: THE DOCTOR’S STORY.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dcw.jpg" width="100" height="120" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi170">“WANT Berlyng,” he seemed to be saying, though
it was difficult to catch the words, for we were
almost within range, and the fight was a sharp
one. It was the old story of India frontier warfare;
too small a force and a foe foolishly underrated.</p>

<p>The man they had just brought in&mdash;laying him hurriedly
on a bed of pine-needles, in the shade of the
conifers where I had halted my little train&mdash;poor
Charles Noon of the Sikhs, was done for. His right
hand was off at the wrist, and the shoulder was almost
severed.</p>

<p>I bent my ear to his lips, and heard the words which
sounded like “Want Berlyng.”</p>

<p>We had a man called Berlyng in the force&mdash;a gunner&mdash;who
was round at the other side of the fort that
was to be taken before night, two miles away at least.</p>

<p>“Do you want Berlyng?” I asked slowly and distinctly.
Noon nodded, and his lips moved. I bent
my head again till my ear almost touched his lips.</p>

<p>“How long have I?” he was asking.</p>

<p>“Not long, I’m afraid, old chap.”</p>

<p>His lips closed with a queer, distressed look. He was
sorry to die. “How long?” he asked again.</p>

<p>“About an hour.”</p>

<p>But I knew it was less. I attended to others, thinking
all the while of poor Noon. His home life was
little known, but there was some story about an engagement
at Poonah the previous warm weather. Noon
was rich, and he cared for the girl; but she did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
return the feeling. In fact, there was some one else.
It appears that the girl’s people were ambitious and
poor, and that Noon had promised large settlements.
At all events, the engagement was a known affair, and
gossips whispered that Noon knew about the some one
else and would not give her up. He was, I know,
thought badly of by some, especially by the elders.</p>

<p>However, the end of it all lay on a sheet beneath the
pines and watched me with such persistence that I was
at last forced to go to him.</p>

<p>“Have you sent for Berlyng?” he asked, with a
breathlessness which I know too well.</p>

<p>Now, I had not sent for Berlyng, and it requires
more nerve than I possess to tell unnecessary lies to a
dying man. The necessary ones are quite different,
and I shall not think of them when I go to my account.</p>

<p>“Berlyng could not come if I sent for him,” I replied
soothingly. “He is two miles away from here,
trenching the North Wall, and I have nobody to send.
The messenger would have to run the gauntlet of the
enemy’s earthworks.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give the man a hundred pounds who does it,”
replied Noon, in his breathless whisper. “Berlyng
will come sharp enough. He hates me too much.”</p>

<p>He broke off with a laugh which made me feel sick.</p>

<p>I found a wounded water-carrier&mdash;a fellow with a
stray bullet in his hand&mdash;who volunteered to find
Berlyng, and then I returned to Noon and told him
what I had done. I knew that Berlyng could not come.</p>

<p>He nodded and I think he said, “God bless you.”</p>

<p>“I want to put something right,” he said, after an
effort; “I’ve been a blackguard.”</p>

<p>I waited a little, in case Noon wished to repose some
confidence in me. Things are so seldom put right that
it is wise to facilitate such intentions. But it appeared
obvious that what Noon had to say could only be said
to Berlyng. They had, it subsequently transpired, not
been on speaking terms for some months.</p>

<p>I was turning away when Noon suddenly cried out
in his natural voice, “There <i>is</i> Berlyng.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>I turned and saw one of my men, Swerney, carrying
in a gunner. It might be Berlyng, for the uniform
was that of a captain, but I could not see his face.
Noon, however, seemed to recognize him.</p>

<p>I showed Swerney where to lay his man, close to me,
alongside Noon, who at that moment required all my
attention, for he had fainted.</p>

<p>In a moment Noon recovered, despite the heat, which
was tremendous. He lay quite still, looking up at the
patches of blue sky between the dark, motionless tops
of the pine trees.</p>

<p>His face was livid under the sunburn, and as I
wiped the perspiration from his forehead he closed his
eyes with the abandon of a child. Some men, I have
found, die like children going to sleep. He slowly
recovered and I gave him a few drops of brandy. I
thought he was dying and decided to let Berlyng wait.</p>

<p>I did not even glance at him as he lay, covered with
dust and blackened by the smoke of his beloved nine-pounders,
a little to the left of Noon and behind me as
I knelt at the latter’s side. After a while his eyes
grew brighter and he began to look about him.</p>

<p>He turned his head, painfully, for the muscles of
his neck were injured, and caught sight of the gunner’s
uniform. “Is that Berlyng?” he asked, excitedly.
“Yes.”</p>

<p>He dragged himself up and tried to get nearer to
Berlyng. And I helped him. They were close alongside
each other. Berlyng was lying on his back, staring
up at the blue patches between the pine-trees.</p>

<p>Noon turned on his left elbow and began whispering
into the smoke-grimed ear.</p>

<p>“Berlyng,” I heard him say, “I was a blackguard.
I am sorry, old man. I played it very low down. It
was a dirty trick. It was my money&mdash;and her people
were anxious for her to marry a rich man. I worked
it through her people. I wanted her so badly that I
forgot I&mdash;was supposed&mdash;to be a&mdash;gentleman. I found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
out&mdash;that it was you&mdash;she cared for. But I couldn’t
make up my mind to give her up. I kept her&mdash;to her
word. And now it’s all up with me&mdash;but you’ll pull
through and it will all&mdash;come right. Give her my&mdash;love&mdash;old
chap. You can now&mdash;because I’m done. I’m
glad they brought you in&mdash;because I’ve been able&mdash;to
tell you&mdash;that it is you she cares for. You&mdash;Berlyng,
old chap, who used to be a chum of mine. She cares
for you&mdash;God, you’re in luck! I don’t know whether
she’s told you&mdash;and I was&mdash;a d&mdash;d blackguard.”</p>

<p>His jaw suddenly dropped&mdash;and he rolled forward
with his face against Berlyng’s shoulder.</p>

<p>Berlyng was dead when they brought him in. He
had heard nothing. Or perhaps he had heard and
understood&mdash;everything.</p>

<h2 class="p2">DOCTOR GREENFIELD.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dcd.jpg" width="100" height="120" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi120">DR. GREENFIELD looked round his small
study with satisfaction and a touch of pride.
In spite of the book-cases filled with treatises
on medicines and diseases, and the inevitable patient’s
chair, the room still managed to be an attractive one.
The book-cases were of oak; the dreaded chair lay
claim to be a particularly good specimen of an early
Sheraton; and over the chimney-piece, and on all
available space of the soft green-colored walls hung
good mezzotint prints in dark frames.</p>

<p>The servant put a match to the log-laid fire, for although
it was May, there was an evening chill, and a
sensation of damp.</p>

<p>The Doctor had dined early, with the expectation
of a long drive, so his evening at home was unintentional,
and caused by the little piece of pink paper
which now lay unheeded at his feet. He stretched
himself, felt how tired he was, and how luxurious was
this unexpected evening at home. Then he remembered
the cause and, with an involuntary movement,
stooped and picked up the paper from where it lay.
He opened it and read it again, though he had done
so several times already.</p>

<p>A telegram so short, but he knew what it had meant
to the sender of it; a lifelong message of despair, of
shipwrecked hopes and utter loneliness. “Charlie died
this evening.” Dr. Greenfield read it out loud quite
slowly&mdash;and once more it fluttered to the ground, and
he sighed. So it was all over; the eight weeks’ watching;
the alternate hope and despair; the grim fight
with death&mdash;and death had triumphed. He saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
girl, the sender of the message, standing as she had
done when he told her that her brother must die. He
thought of the weeks during which time he had been
so much thrown with this girl&mdash;Juliet Carson&mdash;the
days which they had spent together watching by the
sick man’s bed, fighting the battle of skill and science
with destiny.</p>

<p>And all the time his mind dwelt on it, he knew it did
not really touch him&mdash;the worst part to him was that
his science had failed him. For a moment he let himself
believe that the constant facing death, which as
a doctor he was bound to confront, had hardened his
feelings, made him callous, and taken his sense of pity
and sympathy from him; but he was too honest, and
he remembered with a true flash of conviction that it
had always been so, and memory took him back over
many years, and he seemed to hear his nurse saying,
“Master George has no heart, he didn’t feel his father’s
death a bit.” And it came to him how right she
had been, how he had wanted to care, but something
wouldn’t let him; he could not cry as his brother did,
and he had felt as if he belonged somewhere else. All
his later life, too, he had known it. He had no sympathy,
no pity, and he knew that others felt the want
in him, though often they did not know what it was.
He had lived for thirty-five years now, and he had
never cared for anyone; and for the first time to-night,
as he sat and looked into the fire, he knew that his life
had been only half complete, that he lacked what was
the best, and that his whole existence had been colourless.
Still, as he argued against himself, if he had
lacked the best, he had also missed the worst: many of
his friends had gone; he had wanted to care, but the
power was not there; he had seen piteous sights; he
had witnessed heartrending scenes of poverty and despair,
but they had all been nothing to him; they had
passed by, and he had forgotten.</p>

<p>Somehow the image of Juliet to-night came back to
him; the girl in her sorrow and loneliness with no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
left to her; and he wondered why his heart was not
wrung with pity. Although she did not stir his heart,
or his senses, he could see she was beautiful; but for
some other man, not for him. A new and painful sensation
of loneliness suddenly swept over him, a horrible
whiff of middle age, a foretaste of the solitude of
old age, which must overtake him, but he could do
nothing to help himself, he had no will, no power. He
sat on in his deep reverie, with his eyes fixed on the
burning logs. Then he got up from his chair and went
to the window and looked out on the May evening.</p>

<p>It was half-past eight o’clock, and the chill which
comes just after sunset was in the air. He stood looking
into the clear blue distance, listening to the nightingales
and the hum of the bees. Then suddenly he
saw a sight which astonished him&mdash;a procession winding
its way down the long avenue of limes which faced
his window: a curious procession, too&mdash;a funeral&mdash;it
was unlike any he had seen before. It gave him a
strange sensation. Preceding it were men and women,
chanting as they went.</p>

<p>They paused as they came near to him, the singing
ceased, and several made a gesture as if they would
ask him to join them; then they drew back as he heard
one say, “Ah, not him; he knows no pity, he has no
love, he cannot come;” and they passed on, taking up
their chant; and for the first time in his life he knew
he was an outcast and a pariah. He was hungering
and thirsting for someone to help him and pity him.</p>

<p>Behind them came men carrying the body of the
dead man, and he bowed as they went by. Once more
he looked, and he saw three figures&mdash;three white-robed
women, walking together. And the one who walked
in the midst had the eyes of Juliet Carson, and in her
hands she held a large cup. The three paused as they
came near to him, and it seemed to him as if a veil fell
between the rest of the procession and them, the music
got fainter, and he was left alone with these three;
something within him told him that they held in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
cup the power of pity and love, that they alone could
give them to him, and he cried to them to take pity on
him. Then Juliet, for it was Juliet, spoke to him; her
eyes were troubled, though her face shone with a radiant
smile, and her voice came to him as a soft wind,
and stilled his despair and restlessness.</p>

<p>“Listen,” she said, “and know what you ask. We
are three sisters, Love, Joy, and Sorrow, and if you
drink of this cup you can never again be as you were.
You would wish, likely, to take only Love and Joy, but
as love brings joy, so also it surely brings sorrow, and
you cannot take one without the other. Say, will you
take Love, and in so doing accept Joy and Sorrow as
they come?” and she paused while he made his choice.</p>

<p>But with eager, trembling hands he took the cup she
offered him and drank thirstily, and then&mdash;his whole
being was flooded with hope and delight, and as he
handed the cup back to Juliet in her radiant form of
love, she bent forward a little and kissed him&mdash;a kiss
which thrilled his soul, and sent the life-blood rushing
through his veins. Then the figures vanished. Once
more he heard the faint sound of distant music, and
then&mdash;and then<span style="letter-spacing: 0.5em;"> * * * </span></p>

<p>The Doctor straightened himself in his chair, and
looked round him in a dazed, bewildered manner.</p>

<p>“A dream,” he murmured. “Is it possible? I,
too, of all men.”</p>

<p>He looked round him. The May morning was
breaking into his room, the birds were singing, the sun
was up. So then he had fallen asleep in his chair,
and all that seemed so real, so tangible, was nothing
but a dream&mdash;a dream of possibilities, and an awakening
to realities.</p>

<p>As his mind grew clearer, he remembered all that
had taken place the night before&mdash;ah! that telegram
was the reality; and once more he stooped to pick it
up. But, as he read it, a new feeling, and yet not a
new feeling came to him&mdash;the sensation of his dream.
It made him giddy, and he went to the window to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
steady himself, and to feel the air. But in him, and
all around him, he was conscious of a change; a rush
of almost divine pity and love swept across him. Ah!
that, then, was no dream; he was in touch with the
love, the sorrow, and pity of the world; he shared them
all; he was one of them, he was no longer the pariah,
the outcast; and more than that, he too loved, and his
love had been alone with her suffering and sorrow all
night. Last night he had not cared; to-day the pity
of it almost stifled him.</p>

<p>He threw up the window and stepped onto the lawn;
the fresh dew was upon everything, and he stretched
himself in the rays of the sun, and thanked God that
he was alive. He looked long up the avenue, where
in his dream he had seen the procession come down,
and he shuddered when he thought how they had left
him&mdash;no, not all&mdash;and his heart beat as he thought of
Juliet Carson, and how she had come to him at the
time of his great want. And the thought of her
brought back to him the reality and the present, and,
as he listened to the clock striking six, he knew that
his restlessness must wait; he who had waited all his
life was now impatient for two hours to be over. Ah!
had it come to this. He smiled at his own impetuosity,
but had not the heart to rebuke himself.</p>

<p>He spent the next two hours wandering up and
down his garden, listening to the morning sounds, as
the world woke bit by bit to its day’s work. He
watched the workmen pass by his gate on their way to
take up their daily toil, and he wondered why he had
never pitied them&mdash;his had been so much more a case
of pity. Though worn and tired, and perhaps saddened,
they, too, had loved; they had somewhere, sometime,
romance in their lives.</p>

<p>As the church clock struck eight he made his way
to the stables and ordered his dog-cart. His own voice
had a conscious sound in it, and he felt all the world
must know he was a changed man. As he drove
through the deep lanes, with the honeysuckle, pink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
may, and wild cherry blossom all in their beauty before
him, he felt that there was only life, only beauty
in the world, and all the sorrowful and sad side of it
had fled away. But as he neared the old manor house,
where death triumphed, his beating heart quietened
somewhat, and he felt a touch of sorrow come over
him.</p>

<p>He was evidently expected, for he was admitted at
once into the long low room, into which the sun was
pouring. The window was thrown up, and as he
paused he felt that the stillness of death was in the
house. Then he heard a slight movement and turned.
At the open window stood Juliet, the sun’s rays lighting
up her white gown, and her brown hair; her eyes
had the troubled expression of his dream, but there
was no radiance in the sad, weary, little face. In her
hands she held great branches of white lilacs, lilies,
and roses.</p>

<p>He went to meet her with outstretched hand, and a
great pity in his heart spiritualizing his human love.</p>

<p>“I knew,” she said simply; “I knew you would
come.” Had she, too, seen the vision, or was it in his
face?</p>

<p>And did she bend her head as in his dream?&mdash;for
his lips found hers, and that kiss drew the bitterness
from her sorrow, while it opened up his new life for
him, sweeping away all the years he had left behind,
and flooding his soul with light and love.</p>

<p>And although they were in the presence of death,
did not love triumph?</p>

<h2 class="p2">DR. GLADMAN, A SKETCH OF COLONIAL LIFE.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dci.jpg" width="100" height="118" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi080">IT WAS Christmas morning in Southern latitudes.
The thermometer stood at 80 degrees
in the shade, and we had just finished a really
splendid run across the Pacific, right away from the
Cape, without touching, and we were all delighted to
be once more about to stand on terra firma. I had
signed articles in London, at a shilling a month, as
surgeon, to the good ship “Teneriffe,” the Company
naturally considering the said shilling good pay in
addition to a free passage for myself, and at a reduced
rate for my wife, to Sidney.</p>

<p>We were passing a lighthouse, and could see the
smoke rising from the little settlement at King
George’s Sound. The houses and harbour itself were
hidden by the first of the many headlands that were
between us and the narrow opening to the anchorage.
There was the usual bustle on deck and tramping to
and fro of the sailors, who were getting the anchor
clear and the decks in readiness to let go.</p>

<p>My wife and her sister were making certain changes
in their dress that they might be ready the moment
we dropped anchor to go ashore. I could hear my
wife ask her sister Rosie if she could really believe
“this everlasting voyage was over?” as I was hurriedly
finishing off my letters in the saloon to take
ashore. I had just fastened and sealed up a long
letter to my friend H. at “Bart’s,” and another to
my mother in peaceful Devonshire, and had done the
same for some half dozen or more of my wife’s, when
I heard the orders, “Hard a-port,” “Ease her,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
“Slow,” passed to the wheel and engine room as the
pilot’s boat came alongside. It was manned by four
rowers in man-o’-war’s-man dress, and a tiny golden-haired
boy, who didn’t look more than ten, in the stern
holding the tiller ropes in his little brown fist, and
keeping his eyes fixed on the pilot’s movements till he
was safe on deck. Then he said authoritatively, “Let
go the rope; fall astern,” rolling the “r” and giving
it “starn” in the approved style.</p>

<p>I ran down the companion-way again, and knocked
at our state-room to tell my women-folk to come up and
see him&mdash;they both are so fond of children. On going
in I found my wife standing in the midst of open portmanteaus,
fastening on her sister’s white veil or puggery,
attired herself in shore-going garments, and with
another long red-and-white-striped puggery shading
her own neck. My wife insists on considering Australia
tropical!</p>

<p>“Do they wear gloves, do you suppose, in this
place?” she said, taking a long pair of grey ones off
the cabin sofa, with a somewhat scornful emphasis on
the “this place” which expressed her private feeling
about Australia generally.</p>

<p>“Of course they do; life in Australian towns is
the same as life anywhere else,” I said, proud of my
information, derived from the blue-books of the Agent-General.</p>

<p>My wife smiled. She has a peculiarly sweet way of
smiling sometimes, instead of answering one, which is
equivalent to her to having the last word, and is far
more than equivalent to me, and very trying, as I have
to conjecture what the last word would have been.</p>

<p>We all went on deck. The pilot’s boat was already
some distance astern, and we could hardly see the little
boy. We found we were steaming slowly through the
blue water, past the swelling furze-covered headlands,
the one we had just passed being crowned by a white
lighthouse, with what looked at the distance a tiny
white cottage, with neat palings and outhouses
round it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>The pilot was in command on the bridge. We could
see his figure against the sky, standing on the narrow
strip of a platform, from which the officer of the watch
rules his seagirt kingdom with an even more absolute
despotism than that of the sultans of the “Arabian
Nights.” His broad back, upright figure, and strong
hands grasping the rail in front, gave one a sense of
security, though the quick clear enunciation of the
necessary orders was not quite that of a sailor, or at
least did not sound so, after the jolly roar to which
we were accustomed in our skipper.</p>

<p>For all that, we soon found ourselves safely anchored
well in sight of the tiny jetty of the straggling collection
of wooden and corrugated iron buildings that
form the town of Albany.</p>

<p>The ship was at once surrounded by a swarm of copper-coloured
savages&mdash;lads and men, from apparently
ten years old to about thirty&mdash;more or less nude, who
proceeded, one out of each pair in their rough boats,
to dive into the clear blue water after the coins the
passengers threw in, and which they came up holding
in their white teeth, shaking the water out of their
close black curls.</p>

<p>We were watching two of these chattering gleaming
“bronzes,” as my wife called them, averring that unless
you looked upon them as statuary they were really
not proper, when the captain came up to us, as we
leant over the bulwarks, to introduce the pilot, who
stood just behind him with an amused smile at my
wife’s last remark.</p>

<p>“Doctor, let me introduce Dr. Gladman, our pilot,
to you,” said our skipper. “Mrs. M. and Miss N.,
this is our parish doctor, health officer, and pilot&mdash;Dr.
Gladman.”</p>

<p>The pilot bowed, and holding his peaked cap in his
left hand stood with his close curling grey hair uncovered
in the glowing Australian sunshine, while he
shook hands with my wife and her sister. “Welcome
to Australia, ladies,” said he, still holding his cap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you, doctor,” said my wife. “But are you
not afraid to remain uncovered in this dreadful sun?”</p>

<p>“Not for a short moment, madam,” he replied, and
added, glancing at her delicate pale face and the more
blooming cheeks of her sister, “We naturalised Australians
long ago gave up all hope of having your
beautiful English complexions,” replaced his cap.</p>

<p>“Naturalised?” echoed Rosie, looking ready to
shake hands over again. “Are you really an Englishman,
Dr. Gladman? Oh! I am so glad. I was afraid
every one would be Australian&mdash;Colonial now.”</p>

<p>Dr. Gladman laughed. “A good colonist,” he said,
“but not a Colonial. No, it certainly seems a very
long time ago, but I did originally come from ‘Home,’
as we say out here. I was born in Buckinghamshire,
and bred at Bart’s.”</p>

<p>The magic word Bart’s&mdash;my beloved hospital!&mdash;completed
the charm Dr. Gladman’s fine head, clever
face, and quick cheery speech had worked.</p>

<p>Here was a brother in arms, at the first push off!
As we made the tour of the ship together, necessary
before he could give us our clean bill of health and a
soul could leave the ship, I found he had known several
of the older men of my time who were youngsters
in his. He had qualified fifteen years before I did,
but by the time we had reached the cabin to go over
the ship’s papers with the captain he seemed an old
friend. There is something in the air of strange lands
that draws Englishmen together. I had been sent
out for my health; so had he, he told me with a jolly
laugh, “quite a wreck, they said, ten years ago!” I
told him the latest medical news from England, and
found he was only a fortnight behind me! and saw his
<i>Medical Journal</i> and <i>Lancet</i> as regularly as I did.
As we sat down to the saloon table, I asked him how
they managed for a pilot, supposing a ship should
come in and signal for one, while he was away across
the bay, or over on the bush, in his capacity of doctor.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Dr. Gladman, “it doesn’t often happen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
You see the regular liners&mdash;the P. and O. and Orient
boats&mdash;don’t require a pilot, they come in so often.
I don’t quite know why you signalled for one, skipper,”
he added, turning to the captain, who had ordered
sherry to be put on the table, and was sitting
with his elbows well squared putting his very black
and inky signature to the ship’s papers.</p>

<p>“I’ve never been in here as skipper before. Why,
it must be four years since I was here at all, Gladman.
I was chief officer on the ‘Regulus,’ don’t you
remember, when I last came into the Sound? Let’s
see, in 1880 it was.”</p>

<p>“Ay, so you were,” returned the pilot; “but,” he
added, turning to me, “one of my boat’s crew has a
pilot’s license too, and can take a boat in quite as well
as I can. If they don’t care to have him, they have
to wait till I get back, if I am out. Once or twice
I’ve been run very hard though, doing pilot and doctor
at the same time almost.”</p>

<p>“I remember, Gladman, just this very day, eight
years ago,” struck in the captain, “you took in the
‘Badger’ for Captain D&mdash;&mdash;. I was his mate then,
just before that awful gale of wind when the old
jetty was nearly washed to pieces. It was the first
time I ever saw you, and you were off then to some
good lady&mdash;do you remember?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember that,” said the pilot, balancing
his silver pencil-case on his finger. “I hadn’t my little
coxswain with me then, had I, skipper?”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you? Oh! no&mdash;of course you hadn’t”&mdash;and
the skipper laughed. “He was only born that
night, was he? Dear, dear, how time flies! So he is
eight years old to-day! Here’s to him!” And the
skipper raised his glass, and so did the doctor, saying
to me, “It’s the little chap you noticed in my boat&mdash;my
little coxswain.”</p>

<p>I drank my glass also to the little fellow’s health,
and then the captain said:</p>

<p>“Tell the doctor, Gladman, how you came to take
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is his name?” I said. “I saw a curly-headed
little fellow in the stern of your boat, and also
that you had four men besides. That is a good large
crew, isn’t it, simply to pull you out to a ship and
back?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a man too much, either, doctor, and when
you have seen our Breaksea in a storm of wind and
rain you’ll agree with me. Besides, that gig is all
I have to take me to my patients across the bay, up
the harbour to the town. Of course there is a path
to the town round the cliffs from the lighthouse,
where I live.”</p>

<p>“You saw it as we passed, doctor. Gladman is
lighthouse-keeper, among other things,” put in the
skipper.</p>

<p>“But,” went on the pilot, smiling at the interpolation,
“it is a long way round, and I haven’t time
for long ways round. We get all our provisions, too,
by the boat, and my wife goes to church and pays her
calls in it. She is a first-rate sailor, isn’t she, skipper?
And as for that monkey, Jack&mdash;my little coxswain&mdash;he’s
a far better pilot than I am.”</p>

<p>“Is he now?” said the captain. “Tell the doctor
how you came to take him,” he said, with a sailor’s
love of a good yarn.</p>

<p>“He is not your son, then?” I said, a little surprised;
for I had noticed that the child was more carefully
dressed than one would expect one of the crew’s
lads to be.</p>

<p>“Well, he is, and he isn’t. My wife and I adopted
him. We lost our little one&mdash;it was a girl though&mdash;the
day he was born. Yes, it is eight years ago to-day
our little one was down with scarlet fever. She was
nearly two. There had been an epidemic of it in the
town, but I never knew how the child got it, up there
miles away, unless, you know, doctor,” he said a little
sadly, “I took it up to the cottage myself&mdash;I always
feared so. I used, before then, to think if I had been
to any infectious cases in the town, that after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
couple of hours’ row across and round the point I
should be safe and not take anything up to the cottage.
Anyhow, the little thing had it, and badly; I
hadn’t much hope in the morning. My poor little
wife&mdash;she was one of your Bart’s sisters before I married
her&mdash;literally fought the disease inch by inch,
and we both of course did all that could be done. I
had sat up half the night&mdash;Christmas Eve&mdash;with the
little maid. It was one of those bad throat cases,
doctor,” said the pilot, a little gruffly, turning to me.</p>

<p>I nodded, and he went on: “About seven, one of
the men at the lighthouse came to say a pilot was signalled
for by a ship off the head.”</p>

<p>“That was the ‘Badger’&mdash;ay. I remember you
coming aboard in the cool of the morning, as well as
if it was to-day,” said the captain.</p>

<p>“The other fellow was away,” continued the pilot;
“so I had a bath and changed all my things, and left
the poor wife, who was beginning to lose hope, sitting
with the baby on her lap. I hardly thought it would
live till I got back. Just as I rounded the headland&mdash;or
was it a bit farther on, skipper&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Thereabouts,” said the skipper.</p>

<p>“We met a boat from the town, and one of the
boatmen called out to know if I was aboard, because I
was wanted in Albany. His wife was taken bad.</p>

<p>“You know what that means, doctor!” grinned the
skipper.</p>

<p>“I ought to, captain,” I said, hearing as he spoke
a smothered murmur from our state-room, from which
I guessed that the dead silence which had till then
prevailed therein was only another proof of the truth
of the saying, that women are curious beings.</p>

<p>Wholly unconscious that he had any other hearers
than myself and the captain, the pilot went on:</p>

<p>“We were steaming into the harbour as quick as
we could, so I told the man to fall astern, and we
towed them behind us. When I got to Mrs. Rogers,
I found that she was better, and that I shouldn’t be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
wanted probably that day at all; but I did not intend
to go back home&mdash;I thought it best not; but after an
hour or two I saw my boat run in alongside the jetty,
and one of the fellows come ashore. In a few moments,
Rogers brought me a note from my wife begging
me to come back if I possibly could; she was
frightened about the child.</p>

<p>“I knew I could do nothing, but I couldn’t bear
the thought of the wife’s being all alone up there and
looking for me&mdash;and perhaps, later on, I shouldn’t be
able to go&mdash;so, as I found when I went up to Rogers’
cottage that everything was put off, and my patient
preparing her husband’s tea, I set off home again.</p>

<p>“The day had clouded over, and the hot wind that
had blown off the land all day had died down, and
there was that dead silence we always have before a
black squall of wind and rain comes up from the sea.</p>

<p>“Before we got across the bay, gusts of wind dead
in our teeth caught us once or twice and curled the
water round her bows; and just as I jumped ashore,
the first dash of rain came. As I stepped on to our
verandah, a great roaring gust nearly swept me away.</p>

<p>“I went up to the windows, and took down one of
the outside shutters my wife had put up to protect the
glass, and saw her sitting with the little one in her
arms. She was relieved to see me, and beckoned to me
to go round and come in. But, you know,” said the
pilot, clearing his throat, “I couldn’t go in, going
back, as I was, to the good woman in labour over at
Albany. It wouldn’t have been safe.”</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “I suppose not;” but I wondered if
I should have been so conscientious if it had been I.</p>

<p>“It may have been hard of me, perhaps,” said the
pilot, looking straight in front of him; “but I thought
it right; and I could do nothing; I knew that when
I left in the morning. I opened the window and told
the wife how it was. She was very good; she wanted
me to come in, of course, if only to kiss the little thing
before it died. But I told her I did not think I ought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
I couldn’t <i>do</i> anything for the child; it was dying
then.”</p>

<p>The good honest fellow stopped a moment, and
again I heard a movement, and I thought a stifled
sob, from our cabin; but the captain broke in in a
rather unnecessarily loud voice:</p>

<p>“You were quite right, doctor. It was very good of
you. I couldn’t have done it myself, I should have
felt so for the missis.”</p>

<p>“I felt for my wife,” said the pilot, in rather a hard
voice; “but I couldn’t have done any good,” he repeated,
as if afraid to trust himself to say anything
else. Then he went on:</p>

<p>“She sent the girl out with some food for me in the
verandah; and we watched the little one, she inside
and I out. I couldn’t hear anything in the room, the
wind roared and shook the verandah so; but I could
see the child was breathing slower. Then my wife put
her hand under the wrap to feel its little feet.” He
broke off, and then added:</p>

<p>“I didn’t see the end. One of the men came up
to say they had signalled for the doctor from the
town. So I had to start back. The gig tore through
the black seas before the gale. It was a pitch dark
night, about eight when I started. I got to Mrs.
Rogers just in time. The youngster was born about
midnight. The mother did very well, and when I left,
about four in the morning, the bay was like a sheet
of glass, and the sun rising without a cloud over the
cliffs. The jetty had been washed away, all but the
stonework, and my men had had to beach our boat
right up on the road.</p>

<p>“When I got back, I found the wife on the lookout
by the lighthouse. She had heard nothing of us, of
course, since I left the night before.”</p>

<p>“That was a hardish day’s work,” said the skipper&mdash;”thirty
hours of it.</p>

<p>“Well, I was not sorry to get my boots off, and
get some sleep, before I started on my round. I’d a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
longish ride that day to the telegraph construction
camp, over the hill there,” said Dr. Gladman, getting
up from the table and taking his cap.</p>

<p>“And your little girl&mdash;doctor?” said my wife, suddenly
appearing at her cabin door, tears on her cheek
and a little gasp in her voice.</p>

<p>“It was dead, ma’am,” said the father, and turned
to the companion and went on deck.</p>

<p>We saw very little more of Dr. Gladman while we
were in Albany. My wife and her sister went up to
the lighthouse and called on his wife. They came
away charmed with her and the dainty little household
she reigned over. My wife was enthusiastic over
the trim garden, cool little parlour, and “exquisitely
clean kitchen,” and “would you believe it,” she said,
“she has only one maid-servant, and that a girl of
seventeen!”</p>

<p>“I think,” she said impressively, stopping in our
walk up and down the deck, as we were taking our last
turn that night after leaving Albany, gliding past
the shadowy coast under the wonderful Southern
Cross&mdash;”I think they are both splendid, those Gladmans.”</p>

<p>A burly figure leaning over the bulwarks, puffing
clouds of smoke into the still night air, turned round,
and the captain’s voice said:</p>

<p>“That’s what they are, ma’am. That’s the sort
of colonist this country wants; a man like Gladman
is worth a whole shipload of the ne’er-do-wells they’re
so fond of sending out. As for such like!&mdash;” he
pointed with his elbow, as he replaced his pipe, to a
group of dissipated-looking youngsters coming up
from the bar, whose determination to drink more than
was good for them had been a source of worry to him
all the way out&mdash;”As for such like,” he said, with a
look it would do many intending emigrants good to
have seen, “I ask you, doctor, what’s the good of
them?”</p>

<h2 class="p2">DR. WRIGHTSON’S ENEMY.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dcf.jpg" width="100" height="120" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi110">FOR the last thirty years, Dr. Wrightson had
been the sole medical adviser of the little town
of Oakhampton, and he was still a hale,
hearty, jovial, stout gentleman, of about sixty years
of age.</p>

<p>Dr. Wrightson lived in the High Street, in a long,
low, white house, which never failed to look as clean
and bright as if it had been thoroughly done (apparently
fresh from the foundry) announced in large
letters to every passer-by that this was the abode of
Dr. Wrightson. To the left of the white house stood
the surgery, which was marked by a glaring red lamp
and several bells, and over this surgery presided a
helpless and timid young man named Titmas, the
doctor’s only assistant.</p>

<p>Many wondered how it was that Dr. Wrightson did
not engage a partner in his business; but that gentleman
invariably turned a deaf ear to all hints of this
nature. He was strong and well, he said, and able
to do his work himself without any help at present.
There would be time enough to talk about a partner
when he grew to be an old man. The real fact of the
matter was, that Dr. Wrightson could not bear to
admit “a rival near his throne.” He was fond of his
profession, proud of his reputation in it, and very
jealous of every other practitioner. A partner would
have driven him distracted; and I doubt if he would
ever have allowed him to feel a single pulse, or to
have sent so much as a black draught out of the dispensary,
without his express permission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides this, Dr. Wrightson had another reason for
wishing to keep all the practice of Oakhampton in
his own hands. The doctor had a daughter&mdash;his only
child, and the very apple of his eye. To make, or
save a fortune for Fanny was the first great object of
Dr. Wrightson’s life, his one daily anxiety; and in
this task the worthy doctor found an able and willing
coadjutor in his sister Penelope, who shared all his
hopes and fears, and seconded his endeavours to make
a handsome provision for pretty Fanny. A partner
would necessarily have been very much in the way of
this project. If he did half the work, he would also
have divided the profits, and that would by no means
have suited Dr. Wrightson’s purposes; and, in short,
a partner, or even an assistant above the calibre of the
inoffensive Titmas, who had not two ideas in his head,
would have caused Dr. Wrightson tortures of jealousy
and uneasiness.</p>

<p>Fanny Wrightson had been carefully brought up
at a first-class boarding-school; for her mother died
when she was a very little child, and Aunt Penny, who
then came to take charge of her brother’s establishment,
though an excellent housekeeper, was scarcely
equal to the responsibility of undertaking the education
of her niece. The day she was seventeen, Fanny
returned to Oakhampton as a “<i>finished</i>” young lady,
with a variety of rather useless accomplishments, and
a very slender stock of common sense.</p>

<p>Fanny had, moreover, a fine taste for romance,
which seemed to be in some danger of fading away
from pure inanition at Oakhampton, when an event
occurred which startled the whole Wrightson family
from their usual equanimity, and raised a storm of
conflicting emotions in the heart of pretty Fanny.</p>

<p>“What <i>do</i> you think? what <i>will</i> you say? what <i>is</i>
to be done?” exclaimed Miss Wrightson, as she entered
her brother’s room in an excited manner one
afternoon just before dinner-time.</p>

<p>“Well, Penelope, what’s the matter now? Is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
house on fire, or are there burglars in the cellar, or
what?” asked Dr. Wrightson, quietly looking up from
a medical journal which he was perusing with deep
attention.</p>

<p>“No, no, brother! but something quite as bad. That
old house in Church Street is taken, and by whom, do
you think? By a medical man! There! His name
is Peirce&mdash;Montague Peirce&mdash;and they are coming in
at Lady Day.”</p>

<p>“The deuce they are!” cried Dr. Wrightson, throwing
down his journal with a bang. “Much good may it
do them! I flatter myself the poor man may go back
where he came from without having done <i>me</i> much
injury. I have not lived in Oakhampton all these
years without being able to hold my own against any
impertinent upstart in the kingdom; and so you may
tell him, if you see him, with my compliments&mdash;my
most respectful compliments. Ha, ha, ha! a pretty
joke, indeed. Poor Mr. Montague Peirce! I am sorry
for him. His prospects are not very lively, poor fellow!
Eh? Fanny, my dear, what have you got to say
about it?”</p>

<p>“I say it’s a horrid, wicked shame,” replied Fanny,
throwing her long curls over her shoulders, “and I
quite hate this Mr. Montague Peirce already. What
business has he to come poking his nose into Oakhampton,
of all places? as if anybody would ever think
of sending for him when they could get my dear old
darling papa to attend them. The idea of such a
thing! But never mind, Aunt Penny, perhaps Mr.
Peirce will take some of the poor people who can’t
pay, off papa’s hands; and then he will have more
time to spare for us at home.”</p>

<p>“Bless the child! that’s not a bad idea,” said Dr.
Wrightson. “So we’ll let him have some of the <i>very</i>
poor people, shall we? Yes, yes! so he shall. Excellent
practice for a rising man. Give him confidence
and experience, won’t it? We’ll hope, though, the
poor fellow has not a large family to support, or else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
that he has some private means of his own. He won’t
live in that house for nothing, I can tell him.”</p>

<p>“The rent alone is sixty pounds a year,” remarked
Miss Wrightson; “and the garden is being thoroughly
set in order, Mudge tells me. Mudge has been employed
to do many little odd jobs about the house, and
I met him coming out of it just now. Mudge hears
Mr. Peirce is a single man&mdash;quite a young man&mdash;but
has his mother living with him. He was doing well
in London, and was reckoned very clever there, so the
servants told Mudge; but the air did not suit the old
lady, and so they have come to settle in the country.
I can’t think whoever can have advised them to come
to Oakhampton, of all places.</p>

<p>“Some ignorant busybody who did not know what
he was about, you may depend upon it,” said Dr.
Wrightson. “Now, let’s go to dinner, Penny.”</p>

<p>“It’s not as if you were ever ill, you know, or unable
to attend to your duties,” continued Miss Penelope,
as she walked into the dining-room, “or as if,
when you did go away for a day or two, you could
not get Mr. Halliday, from Littleton, to come and
look after your patients. It’s such a ridiculous thing
of a young man to come down from London, and try
to cut you out at Oakhampton, brother.”</p>

<p>“It merely evinces great folly and presumption on
the part of the young man, my dear Penny, and so
we’ll say no more about the matter.”</p>

<p>But from that day forward the favourite topic in
the Wrightson family was the last enormity committed
by Mr. Montague Peirce.</p>

<p>“I saw that fellow’s trap standing at Hornibrook’s
door,” Dr. Wrightson would suddenly observe; “that
fellow” being the very mildest designation that was
ever bestowed to Mr. Peirce.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I daresay you did. The man makes
free with everybody, I hear,” Miss Wrightson would
reply, indignantly. “He goes and pays people long
visits, and bores them to death, I’ve no doubt, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
then hopes all the town will take it for granted that
he is attending them.”</p>

<p>It was very disagreeable for poor Dr. Wrightson,
when he drove through the streets in his neat, respectable,
blue brougham, to meet this young Peirce dashing
past in his light, smart-looking dog-cart, drawn by a
big chestnut horse; and it was most unpleasant for
the whole family to go to church every Sunday, knowing
they were liable to be jostled against “those
Peirces” in the aisle.</p>

<p>Miss Penelope declared she could hardly bear to
walk down the street, lest she should meet her adversaries;
and as for Fanny, she could not think how it
happened, but she never went near the windows without
seeing the “dreadful man” pass by. It was curious,
that, under these painful circumstances Fanny
should spend the greater part of her time in looking
out of the window. To be sure, Mr. Peirce was as
good-looking and pleasant a young man as could be
met with on a summer’s day, and the old lady, his
mother, was quite a picture in her rich black silks; but
the Wrightsons insisted upon considering the Peirces
as their mortal enemies, and would not listen to a
word in their favour.</p>

<p>The rest of the inhabitants of Oakhampton were
naturally less rancorous against the intruders. The
Peirces were not likely to injure them in any way.
Mr. Priestly, the rector, his wife, and daughters, of
course, called on Mrs. Peirce, and pronounced her to
be a very lady-like, well-informed, agreeable person.
The Pentelows, and the Fanthoms, and the Hornibrooks,
and the Goslings, and old Mr. Lillywhite,
thought it incumbent upon them to follow the example
of the Rector, and it was soon rumoured that the
Peirces were not unlikely to prove a great addition
to the society of Oakhampton. Young men were
scarce articles in that locality, and Mr. Peirce, not
having much to do, entered with great zest into the
cricket matches, and the croquet parties of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides, Oakhampton was a place that was improving
rapidly. That is to say, a railroad had lately run
through the town, and, in consequence, fresh villas,
streets, terraces, and squares, were rising up in every
direction. Quite a new population had been formed
during the last few years, and many of these new comers,
who had not known Dr. Wrightson from their
cradles upwards, rejoiced in the advent of the new
doctor and determined to patronize Mr. Peirce from
London at once. There were, indeed, other persons
in Oakhampton, old inhabitants who should have
known better, but who were so perverse and ill-judging
as to prefer the treatment of Mr. Peirce to that of
Dr. Wrightson, who was by this disaffected party
termed “a twaddling old woman.” Others, again,
there were, who had been affronted occasionally, when,
on sending for Dr. Wrightson himself, they had been
put off with “that stupid creature, Titmas,” who
never seemed to know what he was about; and these
now gladly employed the rival practitioner. With the
best intentions, poor Dr. Wrightson could not possibly
make himself ubiquitous, or attend to fifty patients at
once. Thus it happened one unlucky day, when Dr.
Wrightson had been to pay a visit to his old and faithful
ally, Lady Cardozo, who lived about five miles
from Oakhampton, that Mrs. Pankhurst’s little girl
took the opportunity of swallowing a pin, which stuck
in her throat, and frightened the whole Pankhurst
family into fits. As the case was one quite beyond the
powers of poor Titmas, Mr. Peirce was called in, and
extracted the pin with so much promptitude and skill
that Mrs. Pankhurst was delighted with him, and
asked him to prescribe for her own nervous affections
at the same time, and also, to call the next day and
see how the child was going on. It is true that Mr.
Pankhurst (as in honour bound) called on Dr. Wrightson
immediately, and explained to him fully all the
circumstances of the case, but that headstrong and
unreasonable old gentleman could not be induced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
see the thing at all in its proper light. He looked
annoyed and huffy, and remarked in his most caustic
manner, “that if Mr. and Mrs. Pankhurst were satisfied
with the attendance of Mr. Peirce, that was all
that could be desired.” Dr. Wrightson had not the
slightest wish to interfere, and thought Mr. Pankhurst
could not do better than secure the services of the
young man altogether. Having been so successful in
his treatment of Miss Pankhurst, he would doubtless
continue to give advice to the rest of the family. Perhaps
when Dr. Wrightson said this, he never expected
to be taken at his word; but it did so happen that the
very next week the whole of the little Pankhursts
(eight in number) were seized, in regular rotation,
with the scarlatina, and Mr. Peirce was in regular
attendance at Pankhurst Park for the next three
months. This was a terrible blow to Dr. Wrightson,
for Pankhurst Park was one of the most profitable
households in the neighbourhood; and the Pankhursts
were rich, influential people, and kept a good deal of
company; and of course Mrs. Pankhurst went about
in her usual idiotic manner, recommending Mr. Peirce
as the most wonderful man of the age, and the only
doctor worth consulting in the county.</p>

<p>Still Dr. Wrightson and his sister shook their heads
and shrugged their shoulders, and repeated “that fellow
would be found out before long.” Now, it so happened
that the garden of Dr. Wrightson’s house in
High Street stood at right angles with the garden of
Mr. Peirce’s house in Church Street, and at a certain
point, the walls met. Fanny Wrightson’s bed-room
window commanded an excellent view of the Peirce’s
garden, and it was a never-failing source of interest
to watch the proceedings of the Peirce family. She
was anxious to see what “the enemy” did, when he was
at home, and she soon contrived to make herself complete
mistress of his movements, and became intimately
acquainted with his habits and customs. He
was very kind and attentive to his mother, that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
certain, and apparently he was good to his servants
and spoke civilly to them. They looked as if they
had a great regard for him; even the fat, lazy, old
tabby cat loved him and followed him about, and
jumped upon his shoulder whenever she could get the
opportunity. Fanny could not help rather taking a
fancy to that old cat of the Peirces, and when she got
over the wall into the Wrightson’s garden, Fanny was
actually guilty of giving her some milk sometimes
when her aunt was out.</p>

<p>It was about this time Fanny took violently to the
study of Shakspeare. “Romeo and Juliet” was her
favourite play. What sweet passages there were in
“Romeo and Juliet!” Nothing could be more striking,
for instance, than that part where Juliet exclaims&mdash;”Oh,
Romeo! Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?”</p>

<p>And how affecting were the lines&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq4 p1">“My only love sprung from my only hate,<br />
Too early seen unknown; and known too late,<br />
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,<br />
That I must love a loathed enemy.”</p>

<p class="p1">But nothing would induce either Dr. Wrightson or
his sister to allow the poor Peirces any quarter. He
was an interloper and an adversary of the most aggressive
nature. If Mr. Peirce happening to meet Dr.
Wrightson in the street, should, in the innocence of
his heart, take off his hat in passing, the old gentleman
would turn his head the other way and pretend not to
see him, or would coldly return the greeting with a
gesture of intense disgust.</p>

<p>When Miss Wrightson and Mrs. Peirce met at the
house of some mutual acquaintance, as was not unfrequently
the case, the spinster would draw herself up,
tuck in her chin, and curtsey in her stiffest manner
to the widow, and declining all conversation, would
sniff alarmingly during the whole period that Mrs.
Peirce remained in the room. Neither the doctor nor
his sister scrupled to express the utmost solicitude for
all Mr. Peirce’s patients. They feared any sick person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
ran a very poor chance who had Peirce for their
medical attendant, and they did not hesitate to say
that rather than be left to the mercy of “that inexperienced,
conceited young fool,” they would prefer
being in the hands of Mr. Titmas himself.</p>

<p>In spite of all they thought, said, and looked, however,
Mr. Peirce’s practice increased daily. The farmers
and their families flocked to his door on market
days, for “the young man from London” had performed
some almost miraculous cures, it was stoutly
averred. Then many of the tradespeople thought it
fair to give “young Peirce” a turn now and then,
and his reputation spread to the servants of some great
families in the neighbourhood. Old Lady Cardozo’s
own maid actually refused to consult Dr. Wrightson
about her digestion, and announced boldly “that Mr.
Peirce had done such wonders for her cousin, Mrs.
Hogsflesh, the butcher’s wife, in a similar case, that
rather than not have the benefit of his advice, she
would walk all the way into Oakhampton on her own
legs, and pay him for it out of her own money.” And
so good an effect had Mr. Peirce’s medicine upon the
malady of Mrs. Milliken, that the good woman entreated
her mistress to try just one bottle of it, for
her ladyship suffered sadly from precisely the same
symptoms as Mrs. Hogsflesh. The dose, taken surreptitiously
and in great fear and trembling by old Lady
Cardozo, was most efficacious, and though she was too
loyal to her old friend to desert Dr. Wrightson altogether,
still Lady Cardozo sent Mrs. Milliken constantly
into Oakhampton on secret embassies to Mr.
Peirce for further supplies of his very excellent remedy
for a weak digestion.</p>

<p>And so the autumn slipped away, and the trees grew
bare, and the winds howled, and the damp, chilly fogs
of November fell upon the little town of Oakhampton,
and the more Fanny saw of her father’s enemy, the
less it became in her power to hate him, as she felt
a good and dutiful daughter should do. This made
her very unhappy at times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Lectures on scientific subjects were quite an annual
institution in Oakhampton during the long winter
evenings. Fanny Wrightson had always been a very
regular attendant at these lectures, not that she understood
what they were about, the least in the world, or
that she came home a bit wiser than she went out, but
the lectures offered some excuse for a very mild kind
of dissipation, and Fanny’s life was a monotonous
one. This year Fanny was more devoted than ever to
the “pursuit of knowledge under difficulties,” for
Mrs. Peirce and her son were sure to be at the Athenæum,
and it sometimes happened (Fanny declared
she never knew how) that she found herself seated
next to the Peirces, and then Mr. Peirce would very
good-naturedly explain to her everything that she
could not understand, and would make the most abstruse
subjects as simple to her as A B C.</p>

<p>Dr. Wrightson never went to lectures. He was too
tired of an evening, even if he had no patients to visit,
and he was glad to take his “forty winks” in his armchair
by the fire. Aunt Penelope was too much afraid
of risking a bad cold to stir out after dark, and so
Fanny was duly called for every Thursday evening at
half-past seven, by her neighbours, the Pentelows, who
also left her again at her own door about ten o’clock;
and when she returned, Dr. and Miss Wrightson were
too sleepy to ask many questions, or to make any
stringent inquiries as to Fanny’s adventures. She
thought it was not worth while to wake them up and
make them uncomfortable by telling them about the
Peirces, and I have no doubt that if they gave the matter
a moment’s thought, they took it for granted that
Fanny invariably sat between her friends, Eliza and
Harriet Pentelow.</p>

<p>It chanced, however, one Thursday morning, that
Dr. Wrightson descried in a shop window a notice,
stating that Montague Peirce, Esq., was to deliver a
lecture on chemistry at the Athenæum that evening,
and he instantly came home, in great wrath and indignation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
to forbid Fanny or any of his household to
attend the lecture, as usual, on pain of his heavy displeasure.
Not any member of his family, he declared,
should “encourage the man to make a Tom-fool of
himself by giving lectures.”</p>

<p>In vain Fanny remonstrated and entreated and
coaxed her father to let her go, that once. Dr. Wrightson
was inexorable, till his pretty little daughter in
despair burst into tears, and then Aunt Penny interfered,
and assured her father that he had better say
no more about it. “Fanny was moped to death at
home, and after all, it would be amusing to hear what
a mess the young idiot made of his lecturing, and how
he would be the laughing-stock of the place, with his
absurd conceit and presumption.” So Fanny at length
obtained a reluctant consent. It was raining hard
when the Pentelows called for her, but Fanny did not
care for that. Wrapped in her large waterproof
cloak, she tripped along the muddy streets to the
Athenæum, feeling very proud and very happy, and
firmly convinced that if she had been forced to stay at
home her heart must have broken at once. Mrs. Peirce
saw her as she entered, and made her a sign to come
and sit by her, and the old lady was so good and kind
as to confide to Fanny her nervous fears for “Monty,”
though, at the same time, she was quite sure his would
be the best lecture of the season. And such was soon
the opinion of everybody in the room. Mr. Peirce
had so fine a voice, so happy a delivery, and such a
thorough knowledge of his subject, that the attention
of the audience was attracted, even by the first few
sentences.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peirce and Fanny were gratified to their
hearts’ content by the acclamations of applause which
greeted the close of the lecture.</p>

<p>The evening wound up with some amusing experiments
with laughing gas by which several school-boys
and a shopman or two were thrown into convulsions
of laughter. This proved so catching, that the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
room was in an uproar of merriment, and the audience
clapped and screamed, and stamped and cheered,
till the whole street resounded with the sounds of
their mirth. At the very height of this confusion, a
rough, dirty-looking man was observed to press hastily
through the crowded hall, towards the platform. His
eager looks and evident anxiety caught the attention
of the lecturer, and he instantly went forward to meet
him.</p>

<p>After speaking to the man for a moment, Mr.
Peirce’s countenance changed to an expression of the
deepest concern and alarm. He whispered a few words
to his mother, and immediately left the room.</p>

<p>“What is it? What has happened? Is anybody
ill?” inquired Fanny of Mrs. Peirce.</p>

<p>“My poor child,” said the old lady, putting her
arm around Fanny’s waist affectionately, “something
very terrible has happened. I hardly know how to
tell you that your father has met with a sad accident.
Can you bear it bravely? They say it is now freezing
very hard out of doors, and the streets are slippery.
It seems Dr. Wrightson, on his way to see a patient,
has fallen down and hurt himself severely. They
have sent for Montague. Let us try to slip quietly
out at that side door, and we shall be at home as soon
as they are.”</p>

<p>It was quite true, that the rain had soon turned to
sleet, and the sleet had frozen as it fell, and the streets
were a perfect sheet of glass, in which the houses were
reflected as in a mirror.</p>

<p>Dr. Wrightson had been sent for to a sick person,
and in picking his way cautiously along the pavement,
he had been suddenly startled, just as he passed the
Athenæum, by the shouts of laughter and applause
that issued from its partly-opened doors. In his astonishment
and irritation at these unexpected sounds,
the doctor made a false step, his foot slipped from
under him, and he fell, with his head on the curbstone
and his leg doubled under him; and there he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
lay, stunned and helpless, till some workingmen passing
by, ran to his assistance.</p>

<p>Seeing he was perfectly unconscious, the men fancied
he was dead, and this was the report that one of
them carried to Mr. Peirce.</p>

<p>When Fanny and Mrs. Peirce made their way into
the street, they found that it was hardly possible to
walk without falling. No horse could keep its footing
at all, and people were slipping and sliding about in
every direction. It was with considerable difficulty
that the two ladies reached Dr. Wrightson’s door in
safety, and there they were met by a melancholy cavalcade.
The good old Doctor lay on a shutter, borne
by half-a-dozen strong men, and was followed by a
crowd of sorrowing friends. At the head of the procession
walked the Rector and Mr. Peirce.</p>

<p>At the surgery-door appeared Mr. Titmas, frightened
at the tramping of so many feet, who, when he
learnt what had occurred, speedily lost the little stock
of presence of mind he had ever possessed, and collapsed
altogether into a state of helpless imbecility.</p>

<p>Miss Wrightson, who was summoned down-stairs
by the shrieks of the parlour-maid, instantly fainted
dead away, in the front hall, just as the lifeless form
of her brother was brought into the house.</p>

<p>Nobody seemed to have any presence of mind but
poor little Fanny, who stood there, pale and trembling
to be sure, but quite ready to obey Mr. Peirce’s directions,
and to make herself useful in every possible way.
Under Mrs. Peirce’s superintendence a bed was soon
prepared for Dr. Wrightson, in his own study; splints
and bandages were procured from the surgery, and
Mr. Peirce proceeded to examine the injuries sustained
by the poor gentleman.</p>

<p>His head was badly cut, but it was hoped that no
great harm was done in that quarter; his right leg,
however, had sustained a compound fracture, and he
seemed much bruised and shaken by his fall. Mr.
Priestly strove to help Mr. Peirce, Mr. Titmas being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
quite incapable of being of the slightest use to anybody,
and Mrs. Peirce proved herself to be a most
valuable and experienced nurse. As soon as Miss
Wrightson was restored to her senses, she sat crying
and rocking herself backwards and forwards, in a corner
of the room, declaring that her brother was dying,
and that she should not long survive him, while Fanny
knelt by her father’s bedside, patiently watching the
proceedings of Mr. Peirce and his mother, and waiting
upon them in a quiet unobtrusive way, which raised
her very much in their opinion.</p>

<p>The first words spoken by Dr. Wrightson were,
“Send for Halliday immediately. I don’t know what
has happened; but it seems to me, I am ill, and Titmas
is no better than a fool. But don’t send for that
fellow Peirce, whatever you do. D’ye hear? all of
you. I tell you I won’t have the man in my house as
long as I am alive to be the master of it.”</p>

<p>“Ahem! my good friend,” began the Rector, gently
clearing his throat, “it is not possible to send to Littleton
to-night; the roads are quite impassable. You
have had the misfortune to slip down yourself, and
your leg has been broken. It is now set, and will, we
trust, under the blessing of Providence, be ere long
restored to use.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Don’t tell me,” cried the Doctor,
angrily, “Halliday must and shall be sent for. He
will come directly he knows I am ill. My leg shall not
be set till Halliday comes. Let no one dare to meddle
with it.”</p>

<p>“Oh! my dear, dear father,” said Fanny, throwing
her arms around him, “do be good and let Mr. Peirce
doctor your leg; it will soon be better, if you will only
lie still and be patient. For the sake of your poor
little Fanny, do let Mr. Peirce stay with you now.
Oh! Mr. Peirce, please don’t mind what he says. Don’t
let papa send you away. If he should say anything
a little rude you won’t listen to him, will you? I
think he is so ill he scarcely knows what he says. Dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Mrs. Peirce, pray ask your son to stay here, whatever
papa may say against it.”</p>

<p>“Nothing will induce me to leave him, as long as I
can be of the slightest use to him, Miss Fanny, you
may depend upon that,” said Mr. Peirce, firmly.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Dr. Wrightson tried to move, but
fell back with a moan, and shut his eyes again. His
face was quite contracted with pain.</p>

<p>“Calm yourself, dear sir,” began Mr. Priestly once
more. “Consider that your system has sustained a
severe shock. You cannot keep your mind too quiet.
Leave everything to us, and try to sleep. Let me entreat
you to lie still, and trust yourself to the kind
care of my very excellent young friend here, and his
good mother. Believe me, you could not possibly be
in better hands.”</p>

<p>“My patients! what will become of my patients?”
groaned Dr. Wrightson presently. “That fellow will
inveigle away every patient I have. If I lose my practice
in Oakhampton, I am a ruined man this night. I
am too old to go away and begin life afresh elsewhere.
You will be left a beggar, my poor child, if I lose my
patients here.”</p>

<p>“If you would allow me, Dr. Wrightson, to act as
your assistant, till you are able to make some arrangement
with your friend Mr. Halliday, I can only say I
should be most happy to do so,” said Mr. Peirce. “I
would, of course, work strictly under your directions,
and follow out your wishes in every respect; and I
would take care to make it understood that I was only
taking your place for the time being. There! now will
you consent to go to sleep with an easy conscience?”</p>

<p>Dr. Wrightson did not answer for some minutes,
then suddenly holding out his hand to Mr. Peirce, he
exclaimed, with tears in his eyes:</p>

<p>“I am at your mercy, sir; I shall lie here for many
a long week to come, and maybe I shall never again be
the man I was. There is a fine opening in Oakhampton,
sir, for a rising young man now. You had better
take advantage of it. I am not able to help myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you, Dr. Wrightson; then you will let me
have my own way,” said Mr. Peirce, quietly; “and
you will consider me as your junior partner till you
are quite strong and well again. Nay, if you have any
scruples about the matter, you shall pay me, just as
you do my friend Titmas&mdash;there need be no obligations
between us. And by the by, to begin with, where were
you bound to this evening? I had better just run
round there at once, and when I return I shall hope to
find you quite comfortable and fast asleep. My mother
will remain here to-night; she is a capital nurse.” And
the young doctor, feeling amply repaid for his services
by a look of intense gratitude from Fanny, retired to
get his instructions from Mr. Titmas.</p>

<p>The next day the snow fell fast and lay thick on the
ground. All communication between Oakhampton and
Littleton was entirely cut off for more than a week.
No Mr. Halliday could by any possibility come over
to attend to the medical requirements of Oakhampton.
Mr. Peirce, however, cheerfully trudged about in his
great jack boots, though he was often up to his waist
in the snow, and he never failed faithfully to report
progress to Dr. Wrightson of all his patients, humoring
the old gentleman by invariably asking his advice
and opinion, though, perhaps, he did not always follow
it very implicitly.</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve, Mr. Halliday, with some difficulty,
made his way to the bedside of his old friend,
and expressed himself highly delighted with the progress
Dr. Wrightson had made. Nothing could have
been more judicious, he declared, than Mr. Peirce’s
mode of treatment. The leg was going on marvellously
well, and though it would naturally be a tedious process
at the doctor’s age, still the bones were knitting
famously already. Dr. Wrightson was most fortunate
at such a moment to fall into such skilful hands.
“There was not one man in a dozen who could have
made so neat a job of such a case.” So said Mr. Halliday
emphatically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah,” sighed Dr. Wrightson; “it’s all very well,
but I’m done for, Halliday. I have had a great shake;
I shall never be fit for much work again after this. I
never was ill before in my life, and at my age one
can’t stand this sort of thing. My poor child here will
suffer for it. I ought to have looked out for a partner
before this, and have got a good round sum down, for
a share in the business. Now it is simply worth nothing
at all. That young fellow Peirce has got hold of
all my patients. They seem to take a fancy to him,
and no partner of mine will have a chance against him.
But he’s a clever dog, and knows what he is about; I
must say that for him.”</p>

<p>“Then, in the name of goodness, why not make him
your partner, Wrightson? It is quite out of the question
that I should come over from Littleton to look
after your patients, and so I tell you plainly. I
could not undertake it. Why not get this young
Peirce now, to put his money in with yours, and save
you all the hard work? That will be your plan,
depend upon it. You will then have Oakhampton
entirely in your own hands, and carry all before you.”</p>

<p>“That’s what they all say,” replied Dr. Wrightson;
“but the man would not be such a fool as to consent to
it, when he can get all my connection away from me
for nothing, if he chooses to try. The ladies are all
for him; he is popular enough here already. They are
tired of me. I am old and worn out, and past my work
now, and Peirce is the man to suit them henceforth in
Oakhampton. I can see it plainer every day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa! dear papa! pray don’t talk in that
dreadful way,” cried Fanny, who was in the room;
“Mr. Peirce is only anxious to work for you, and be of
use to you, till you are better. I assure you he would
gladly be your partner, or do anything to make you
happy and comfortable. Indeed, and indeed, papa,
you may believe me when I tell you this.”</p>

<p>“Bless my heart alive! Fanny, how do you know
what Peirce wants? Why, Fanny, child, what’s all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
this mean, eh? How the girl colours, and how guilty
she looks, a little minx! Come, child, tell me what
makes you think Peirce would like to be my partner
instead of my rival? I should like to know.”</p>

<p>“Here is Mr. Peirce, ask <i>him</i>,” replied Fanny,
hiding her blushing face behind the red moreen curtains
of her father’s bed.</p>

<p>“My object, sir, is not so much to be your partner as
your son,” said Mr. Peirce, coming forward boldly.
“If I can combine the two relations, I shall indeed
esteem myself a fortunate man. Will you let me help
you to work for our dear Fanny? I do not think you
can be more devoted to her interests than I am. Let
me see. Suppose we say a share in your practice would
be worth fifteen hundred pounds&mdash;I have that sum
lying idle at my banker’s at this moment. It shall be
paid into your account as soon as you please. Then
I am not entirely without private means. My father
left me an income of about eight hundred a year. Will
you come to terms and give me Fanny’s hand into the
bargain?”</p>

<p>“What! so you’ve got possession of her heart safe
enough, I’ll warrant me, you young rogue, and I have
not a word to say for myself. I’m fairly conquered;
you’ve won the day. Fanny, where are you? To go
and play such a trick to your poor old bed-ridden
father! Eh! are you not ashamed of yourself, miss?”</p>

<p>“No, papa, not a bit!” said Fanny, coming out of
her concealment behind the curtain; “and you have
nobody but yourself to thank for it, after all; for if
you had not abused poor Montague from morning till
night, I dare say I should never have thought of him
twice, or troubled my head about him in any way. As
it was&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You never thought of anybody else I may venture
to hope, and I am duly grateful to your father for it,”
added Mr. Peirce confidently.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well! Have it your own way. I am a
poor, broken-down, useless, helpless, old man; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
did not think my own daughter would have gone over
to the enemy. When there are traitors in the camp,
I’ve nothing for it but surrender at discretion. Make
your own terms&mdash;give me no quarter&mdash;I’ve deserved
it all for being a wicked, jealous, uncharitable, ill-natured
old brute. You’ve heaped coals of fire enough
on my head, Peirce, if that’s any consolation to you.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow is Christmas Day,” said Fanny, gently
taking her father’s hand, and putting it into that of
her lover. “Now, father dear, promise me you will
never have any more enemies as long as you live, which
we hope will be very, very long, now you have Montague
to take all the hard work off your hands. In
Oakhampton, at least, let us always have in future
‘Peace and good-will towards men.’”</p>

<h2 class="pc2">THE COMING OF THE SHIP: THE DOCTOR’S PATIENT.</h2>

<p class="pbq p2">A selected reading from The Head of a Hundred. Edited
by Maud Wilder Goodwin. Dr. Humphrey Huntoon, a young
Englishman, in the early days of the colonies comes to this
country in pique at the coldness of Elizabeth Romney, his
sweetheart, who is above him in social station. The story is
filled with charming pictures of colonial life and sentiment.
In the opening part of this reading, Huntoon, in a burst of
confidence, tells his old friend, the ship-captain, of his disappointment
in love. In the second part a new ship comes
from England.</p>

<p class="pc1">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="p1">
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dct.jpg" width="100" height="119" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi130 p1">’TIS strange what lightness of spirit comes with
the laying bare of a sore heart. Verily, a
trouble half told is half healed. Here I, who
had not been merry for months, found myself now
smiling in the dark, as I talked of those pleasant days
of old. Then, like a mourner ashamed that he hath
forgot his grief, I caught up my melancholy once more.</p>

<p>“Well, well! All that is over and gone. If she
loved me in those childish years (and I still think she
did), she outgrew the foolishness soon enow. Yet,
from time to time, as she grew into maidenhood, she
let drop some word, some hint, as tho’ she would say,
‘Perhaps!’ but ere I could pry into the meaning of her
words her eyes gathered merriment, like as if they
were laughing at the poor fool who allowed himself to
be cheated thus.</p>

<p>“Once, ere I went to Oxford, I rode beneath her
window. She, leaning out of the casement, did drop a
sprig of lad’s-love, which a moment before she had
been holding to her lips; then, when I looked up, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
my heart in my eyes, she slammed the window to, and
a moment later I heard her calling her dog within.”</p>

<p>“Tush, tush, lad! A woman’s ways are like the
maze at Hampton Court. If thou lose the clew, thou
mayst wander round and round forever and be no
nearer coming out. Why didst thou not ask her flat,
would she have thee for her husband?”</p>

<p>“Why not, indeed. Ah, therein lies the root of all
my bitterness! When I had finished my studies at
Oxford and got my degree as a physician and
chirurgeon in London, I found myself with a scanty
portion of a thousand pounds. Yet had I none the
less high hopes of carving my way to fame and fortune,
as other men have done from still lower estate.
This did I write to Sir William Romney, and in a
packet I enclosed a letter to his daughter.</p>

<p>“Therein I told her anew what she knew of old, that
I loved her. I asked her not to share the fortunes of
a poor adventurer. I did but seek a pledge that she
would grant me a year and a day, and a promise that
if by that time I had aught of success to lay at her feet,
she would look on my suit with favor.”</p>

<p>“It was done like thyself, Humphrey. What answer
made she?”</p>

<p>“Answer! Oh, it makes me mad to think on’t! She
might have said me nay, and yet I would have gone
my way loving her like a knight of old, without hope
of reward or return; but to be flouted and baited, and
badgered and mocked, when I had offered her that
poor thing, my heart&mdash;oh, it was ill done!”</p>

<p>The instinct of my body to keep pace with my restless
and turbulent soul led me to stride up and down,
striving to master the storm within me. When I took
my seat again, Captain Chester drew me on to speak
further.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” he said, “the maid was but the mouthpiece
of her father. I hear of him everywhere as a
hard, cold man.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Ay, ay, ay,” I broke in, “I have said all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
over and over to myself, like a madman, since ever I
received Sir William’s cool note of dismissal, inclosing
the daughter’s mocking lines; but whenever I would
soothe my sore heart with the thought that she wrote
it not of her own free will, my reason says: ‘’Tis
false, and thou knowst it!’ She would brave a thousand
fathers if she really loved, and her will was
crossed. I know, of course, that her refusal jumped
with her father’s wish.”</p>

<p>I was down for a week with that wretched James
City fever. By day I shivered, and by night I burned
with a consuming heat. Pory said it served me right
that I, who had come hither hoping to fatten on the
misfortunes of others, should myself fall a victim.</p>

<p>Thus he talked, like himself, and equally like himself
he stayed by my bedside day and night, scarcely
taking off his clothes, tending me as if I were a baby,
and mixing doses of the bark, a sovran remedy, till he
saw me well on the road to recovery.</p>

<p>My convalescence he cheered as he had cured my illness.
One day (I was quite recovered then) my lively
friend came bounding in, full of excitement.</p>

<p>“A ship lieth in the harbor,” cried he, “and she
hath brought&mdash;what think ye?”</p>

<p>“Sooth, I know not. How should I? And if I did,
‘twere cruel to spoil thy sport by saying so. What is
this wondrous cargo?”</p>

<p>“Why, twenty maids, come out with one that is
already betrothed to Babcock, the blacksmith!”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?”</p>

<p>“What of it, man! Why, ‘twould be the making of
the colony could we get twenty score in place of one.
Ay, I say, ‘twould be the making of this colony. A
shipload of good wives were the best cargo England
could send us.”</p>

<p>“And thou wouldst choose the handsomest for thyself,
by right of thine office, I dare be sworn.”</p>

<p>“Nay, not I. I have ever had too poor luck at play
to throw dice with Fate for such heavy stakes.” With
this he ran out, laughing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>When he was gone, I stretched my head forth from
the window of my lodging. Yonder in the river, a tall
ship lay black against the shining water. I could see
the sailors in their glazed hats and loose, flapping
breeches, casting anchor to the time of their harsh
song. Skiffs and canoes were plying busily betwixt
the ship and the shore. One curious thing I noted,
that, whereas only one went out in each canoe, two
came back; and then, as mine ear caught the ringing
of the church bells, and mine eyes marked the gallants
who had gone of late ill-clad and worse shaven, now
tricked out in bands of fine lawn and ruffles at their
wrists, a sudden light brake on me, and I realized that
all this was because the twenty maids were come, and
straightway these bachelors, who till now had been
quite content in their single estate, must set their silly
hearts on being married.</p>

<p>“Ho! there, Master John!” I shouted, as I caught
sight of Pory’s grizzled head and pointed beard under
my window. “Read me this riddle: ‘What is that
which flies when pursued, and pursues when fled
from?’”</p>

<p>“A maid.”</p>

<p>“Verily, thou art a shrewd fellow to have guessed it.
Come up, therefore, and tell me all thou knowest which
thou mayst do, and yet be gone in five minutes.”</p>

<p>“That my civility may the more brightly shine
against the foil of thine uncivil words, I will come,
and, to heap coals of fire on thy head, I will tell thee
of the scene on shipboard. The choosing of husbands
and wives went on as merrily as the choosing of partners
for a country-dance. It was a busy market, I can
tell thee.”</p>

<p>“A market&mdash;how meanest thou?”</p>

<p>“Why, ‘tis thus they manage it, by bargain and
sale; and belike ‘tis as good an arrangement as any,
since when the husband hath paid down his hundred
pound of tobacco for a wife, he is bound to make himself
believe he hath a bargain, and the wife, seeing he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
hath set so high an estimate on her worth, in honor
must strive to live up to his valuation.”</p>

<p>“And was every one of the twenty maids married
thus?”</p>

<p>“Ay, all but one, and she remained without a partner
from choice, which thou wouldst have declared
impossible. Many offered for her, though she wore her
veil and coverchief close and would not show her features.
But she would look at none, and went off at the
last to lodge with her friend&mdash;one that was taken to
wife by Miles Cary. I was somewhat struck with
curiosity over the conduct of the one unwed maid, and
I searched out her name in the ship’s register, where
she is set down as Elizabeth Devon. Now, fare thee
well! for my five minutes are over, and if I told thee
more, ‘twould be what I know not, and, ergo&mdash;lies.”</p>

<p>After my nimble-witted friend was gone his way, I
sat for long, looking down into the street and watching
the bridal couples as they passed from under Parson
Buckle’s blessing to their new homes. All this billing
and cooing and setting up of new households made me
feel but the more lonely and doleful. So I went not
abroad that day, tho’ I was well enow to be out, but sat
reading and studying with no other comforter than
my pipe. But, to say truth, the pipe is no mean consoler,
and there is no friend that doth so adapt himself
to thine every mood, so partake, as it were, the very
shade and subtlety of thy thought and feeling, as
tobacco. Well, as I sat thus, the day wore on to evening.
The flame in my pipe was expiring with a final
flicker, when a knock sounded at my door.</p>

<p>“Come in!” I called, and Miles Cary entered.</p>

<p>“Why, how now, Cary! Art thou come to complain
of thy bride of half-a-dozen hours? Hath she beaten
thee over the head with the new broomstick, and thou
art ashamed of thy black eye, and come to get it healed
by stealth after dark?”</p>

<p>“Nay, ‘tis nowt that,” answered the burly yeoman,
as he stood awkwardly twirling his Monmouth cap on
the end of his finger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>I saw that my jests were less amusing to him than
to me; so putting off my jibing tone, I asked him seriously
if aught were ailing in his household.</p>

<p>“Ay, ‘tis the friend of my wife.” He grinned with
sheepish pleasure over the last word.</p>

<p>“Is that the unwed maid, Elizabeth Devon, of whom
Master Pory spake?”</p>

<p>“Yes; her arm was hurt on the ship in the storm,
and methinks it must have been ill-treated, for, in
place of mending it grows ever worse; yet have we had
a hard task to persuade her to see the leech, and even
now am I come without her consent. I fear me she is
o’er-headstrong; but my Kate will have nowt said to
her save wi’ cap in hand, and she gives more attention
to her friend than to her husband.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, that is but natural. Grumble not,
Cary; but remember that thy courtship must be done
after marriage, and be content to bear awhile with
coolness.”</p>

<p>I took up my box as I spake, and we went out into
the night together. As we walked through the town,
I marvelled much that all should be changed of a sudden.
‘Twas no longer a camp, but a village. For good
or evil, the first English homes had been planted here
in the heart of the wilderness.</p>

<p>We stopped before Cary’s cottage, and I marked its
shining neatness. The stepping-stone in front of the
door was polished as smooth as marble, and the floor
within, for all it was but of logs rudely smoothed with
an axe, was clean and neatly set in order.</p>

<p>As I stepped into the kitchen, which served for hall
and parlor and dining-room all in one, I was greeted
by the mistress of the house with a deep-bobbing
courtesy which brought her short skirt down over her
bright stockings, and almost hid the high heels and
pointed toes of her wedding slippers.</p>

<p>“Is thy friend badly hurt?” said I.</p>

<p>“Ay, sir, she suffers much, but she bears it ever with
so brave a heart and so cheerful a face that none would
guess it to look at her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hast thou bandages and swathing-cloths at
hand?”</p>

<p>“Nay, not rightly at hand, but a plenty in the sea-chest,
which hath not yet been opened. Wilt thou lend
a hand&mdash;<i>Miles</i>?”</p>

<p>I could but smile to watch the coquetry with which
the name was spoken, and to see how a soft tone and
glance oiled the wheels of life and made the half-sulky
husband her willing slave.</p>

<p>Foreseeing that the uncording of the chest would be
a matter of time, I stepped to the door of the nearer
chamber (the house boasted but two), and finding it
ajar, I bowed my head to its low proportions and
entered.</p>

<p>The room had been filled with flowers, in honor of
the home-coming of the bride. ‘Tis wonderful to me
how thoughtful and tender to women these rough fellows
oft be. The window-sash, its panes filled with
oiled paper, was swung open and the night wind blew
the perfume of wildrose and honeysuckle in my face.
I can feel it still. A single candle shed a dim light
around and threw a yellow ray on a wooden armchair
close to the table.</p>

<p>As I turned me toward this chair, suddenly my
heart stopped beating. If the thing had not been so
wildly impossible, I could have sworn it was Elizabeth
Romney herself sitting there. The maid, whoever she
was, had the same delicate curve of ear and throat,
the same droop of the eyelid, the very trick of the
hand lying open palm upward on the knee.</p>

<p>I brushed my hand across my eyes and looked again.
My God!&mdash;Incredible!&mdash;It could not be!&mdash;yet what a
likeness!</p>

<p>Then I told myself that I was going mad from dwelling
too long on one thought. I must speak and break
the spell. As I opened my lips, a sudden searching
conviction fell upon me like a lightning flash that this
was indeed she, the one woman in the world to me.</p>

<p>I gasped out: “<i>Elizabeth!</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>The maiden turned, and for the first time caught
sight of me standing thus in the doorway. She gave
one low cry of “<i>Thou!</i>”</p>

<p>After that one word we faced each other in blank
silence. The folk in books have ever some pat speech
ready for such a moment; but in real life ‘tis not so.
How could I speak when my brain was whirling like a
millwheel, and my voice choked in my throat? I stood
still and looked upon her, and the longer I looked, the
harder I found it to believe my eyes were not playing
me a trick.</p>

<p>Yet ‘twas but the truth they told me. There she
sat&mdash;she that had been brought up to be tended and
waited upon, and compassed about with luxuries, now
sick and suffering, with only a wooden armchair to
rest upon, and a cottage roof to shelter her. How, in
God’s name, had it come to pass?</p>

<p>Her face was deadly pale, for all she had been three
months on the sea; and now, as she gazed at me, she
grew even whiter, and swayed as though she would
fall in a swoon. But all the while she kept her eyes
fixed steadfastly on mine. They were eyes never to be
forgotten by one who had seen them once. I have
heard folks praise the brilliancy of her glance and the
curling length of her eye-lashes; but, to her lover, there
lay a subtler charm in the tender trouble of her eye-brows,
bending slightly downward toward the inner
corner. I noted it now as distinctly as the drowning
man counts the bubbles in the water.</p>

<p>I was the first to find my voice, and I hated myself
that it sounded hard and stern, when I was mad to
fling myself at her feet and entreat her to trust herself
to me. But that abominable diffidence of mine, which
is so akin to pride, made me seem in her eyes, I doubt
not, like a pragmatical schoolmaster chiding a recreant
child.</p>

<p>“Elizabeth Romney!&mdash;am I dreaming, or is it
indeed thou&mdash;come on the ship with the maids?”</p>

<p>An angry flush swept over the whiteness of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
cheek and rose to meet the hair that curled in childish
rings round her little ears.</p>

<p>“Thou art thinking, perhaps, that I, too, like these
others, am come three thousand miles in search of a
husband?”</p>

<p>I knew not what to say, and so I said nowt.</p>

<p>“Well, believe ‘t if you will!” she flung out, her
eyes one blaze of wrath; “but believe not that thou
art such a husband as I would seek&mdash;not though thou
wert the only man on this side of the ocean, and
though all the tobacco in Virginia were the price in
thine hand.”</p>

<p>“I am not likely to believe that, Mistress Betty,” I
answered bitterly. “Yet would I rather believe anything
than that this journey is a mad prank of thine
without rhyme or reason. Wild and venturesome
thou hast ever been, but never unmindful of thy sex
or thy station.”</p>

<p>“Which means that now I have shown myself
unmindful of both. I thank thee, Humphrey Huntoon;
but till I seek thy counsel, do thou keep thy
censure!”</p>

<p>I know not what we might have spoken further, for
anger was hot in both our hearts; but at that instant
Dame Cary and her good man came in, bearing a roll
of linen and a whale-oil lamp, which, vile smelling as
it was, gave a brighter light than the candle.</p>

<p>As it shone on the maiden’s face, the look of illness
and suffering was more plain to be seen; and I cursed
myself for a fool that I had forgotten all this time the
arm I had been called to tend. I took the linen from
Dame Cary’s hand and tore it into strips.</p>

<p>“Will you be good enough to let me see the hurt?” I
asked, in a constrained voice. Without a word, she
threw back her short cape and showed me the right
arm wound round and round with clumsy swathings,
which I straightway set to work to unwind. It was
well that my calling had trained the fingers to work
coolly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>I went near to breaking out into oaths when I laid
bare the arm and saw how great a bungler had had
charge of the hurt there on the ship. As it was, that
which had been so ill done must be undone.</p>

<p>The doing of this cruel kindness went near to break
my heart, yet she who suffered bore it without a groan.
The free hand grasped the arm of the chair more
closely, and the face was set in the look of one who
would die ere look or sound of weakness be wrung
from her. Only the sharper drawing down of the eyebrow
marked the strain and stress of suffering.</p>

<p>At length, after a time which seemed to me longer
than any month I have known since, the poor arm was
rebound in a pair of splints hastily made from barrel
staves. As I swathed it in band over band of linen, I
turned to Dame Cary&mdash;I dared not trust my voice to
address that other. “Your friend,” quoth I, “hath an
excellent courage.”</p>

<p>“That hath she!” broke in Miles Cary, who had the
true English love of bravery, and who, as he stood by,
holding the lamp while I worked, had been greatly
stirred by the sight of the maid’s endurance. “Had we
but a company of soldiers like her, we had no need
of a stockade round about James City.”</p>

<p>“Ay,” put in his wife, “but ye should have seen her
on the sea! In that great storm when her arm was
broke, she was the only one of us that screamed not,
nor wailed, nor wished herself on land; but went about
cheering and encouraging all.”</p>

<p>Methought I saw a glance of warning pass from
the girl in the chair to the woman in waiting, for she
straightway brake off her discourse, and spake quite
sharply to her husband, bidding him go before with
the light, that we might follow without breaking our
necks.</p>

<p>So they went out and I walked behind them stupidly
as far as the door. There I found my wits, and,
turning back, I stepped close to the armchair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>“The doctor,” quoth I, in a low voice, “craves pardon
for the hurt he could not help.”</p>

<p>“The <i>doctor</i>,” she replied, also speaking very soft,
“is pardoned in advance, for he hath but done his
duty. For the friend, ‘tis another matter. I cannot
soon forget that he has failed me.”</p>

<p>“Yet he, too, hath but thy good at heart, and that
thou wilt some day confess; and so must I leave thee.
Good-night, madam!”</p>

<p>I spoke the last words in a louder tone, and, bowing
low, I passed out of the chamber.</p>

<h2 class="p2">DR. PENNINGTON’S COUNTRY PRACTICE.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dcn.jpg" width="100" height="119" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi120">NEXT to her husband and her children there
was nothing that Mrs. Graham liked better
than worrying herself. To a degree far beyond
that attained by any other woman in Marston,
she enjoyed “the luxury of woe,” and during the last
few days she had been indulging in it without stint.
For during those days there had been five burglaries
in that town, and the little place, ordinarily no more
excited than most summer resorts, had become almost
hysterical. First of all the post-office had been robbed,
and then, as though that robbery had been merely by
way of practice, the thieves on the next night had
broken into a private house. Other robberies had followed
in quick and defiant succession, and within
twenty-four hours the little red brick railroad-station
on Orawaupum Street had been broken into, and the
money in the safe stolen. Then indeed there was excitement,
for, as in all small towns not too remote from
large cities, the station was the real centre of town
life, and its misfortune was looked on almost as a sacrilege.</p>

<p>Even the summer residents seemed to consider it as
such, and when, as was the custom at Marston, the
ladies drove down to the station in the late afternoon
to meet their husbands on their return from the city,
not one but looked at the little red building as though
she expected to hear it cry out against the profanation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>The older ladies sat comfortably in their carriages,
and, in voices pitched high because they were in the
open air, talked volubly of the burglaries. One and
all agreed that they would never have expected a burglary
in Marston, and Mrs. Graham, by reason of her
power of self-worry, speedily obtained a high and
commanding position among them as a sort of possible
martyr. The younger ladies, at the urgent entreaties
of their own or their friends’ inquisitive little brothers,
left their carriages and moved in a pretty crowd
upon the station. There the boys pointed out the
drawers from which the money had been stolen, and
the girls examined them from a distance with respectful
interest. There, too, they saw the station-master
in close conversation with an important-looking person,
while a young man seated on the desk in the
office swung his legs vigorously and looked bored. He
brightened up obviously, however, at the sudden influx
of pretty girls, and removed his hat. The other
men merely glanced at the intruders and continued
their conversation.</p>

<p>When they had seen everything, the young ladies
retreated to the platform, from which they carried
on an animated conversation with their elders in the
carriages, while the bored young man came to the window
and looked at them with admiration.</p>

<p>Suddenly all the talk was checked. Then a murmur
of respectful admiration ran through the crowd
of ladies, and the coachmen sat up straighter and
flicked their horses. Even the ubiquitous small boys
became silent, as into the station yard whirled an
open carriage in which sat a young and very
pretty woman. As soon as it had drawn up near the
platform, the talk began again, this time all directed
at its occupant.</p>

<p>“How do you do to-day, Mrs. Marmaduke?” was
the first remark from everybody, with a rising inflection
on the second syllable of “to-day;” and when
Mrs. Marmaduke had replied that she was very well,
there was a chorus of almost incredulous congratulation.
Then there was a hush, broken in a moment by
Mrs. Graham.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you heard anything of your silver yet?” she
began. Without waiting for an answer, she continued,
“I wonder how you bear it so well. I’m sure I
shouldn’t. I’m dreadfully afraid of burglars, and I
know it would kill me to know that they were in the
house.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t know it,” said Mrs. Marmaduke,
with superiority. “Not even Mr. Marmaduke knew
that they had been there until afterwards.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” returned Mrs. Graham; “but to find
out, even afterwards, that the horrid men had been
there&mdash;ugh!&mdash;and had taken all your silver&mdash;every
bit of it&mdash;”</p>

<p>“They left some,” coolly interrupted the heroine.
Mrs. Graham pretended not to hear her.</p>

<p>“You should have had a burglar-alarm,” she said,
patronizingly. “Mr. Graham is going to have one
put in for me.”</p>

<p>“We have a burglar-alarm,” answered Mrs. Marmaduke.
“But it was out of order.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how annoying!” chorused all the listeners except
Mrs. Graham, who sank back in her seat and signalled
for her daughter Clara to come to her.</p>

<p>Just then the train came around the curve below
the station, and all the adventurous girls retreated to
their carriages. Out from his office ran the old station-master,
followed by the important-looking man
and by the bored young man. The man who carried
the mail-bag to the post-office sauntered up, and for an
instant everything was expectation. Then expectation
became reality and confusion as the train came
to a stop. For a moment there was an outpouring of
passengers, then a thinning out of the crowd, and then
a sort of stampede of the carriages for the post-office,
until, when the train started again, only Mrs. Marmaduke’s
and Mrs. Graham’s remained. Mrs. Marmaduke
lay back in hers, looking at her husband, as
he stood on the platform talking to the bored young
man, while Mrs. Graham, after looking carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
around for her husband, sank back without being able
to find him. Clara Graham had looked also, and when
she could find neither her father nor her brother she
began again the conversation interrupted by the arrival
of the train.</p>

<p>“There were two burglars, mamma,” she said.
“One was rather an old man, they say, while the other
was much younger. And of course there must have
been a third one to watch&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Drive on, George,” interrupted Mrs. Graham;
and the coachman had just turned from the platform
when the gray-bearded station-master ran out.</p>

<p>“Hi, there! Mrs. Graham!” he shouted, waving a
brown envelope, and as the carriage stopped with a
jerk, the old man plunged down from the platform
and ran to it.</p>

<p>“A telegram from Mr. Graham,” he explained,
and, while Mrs. Graham opened it hurriedly, he
waited with one hand on the wheel-guard.</p>

<p>“Who were those two men talking with you, Mr.
Underhill?” asked Clara Graham, inquisitively.</p>

<p>“Wal, the gentleman wi’ the red beard&mdash;him
a-standin’ in the doorway noaw,” answered the old
man, pointing towards the station, “is the representative
o’ th’ <i>Martson Enterprise</i>,&mdash;Mr. Long his name
is. An’ t’other one, him a-talkin’ to Mr. Marm’duke,
‘s ‘porter fur one o’ th’ Noo York papers,&mdash;I don’
rightly know’s name.”</p>

<p>“Clara,” said Mrs. Graham,&mdash;”There’s no answer,
Mr. Underhill. Drive on, George. Clara, your father
won’t be home to-night; he and Phil are detained by
business. They won’t be home until to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” said Clara, cheerfully, “of course we
shall miss them, but I think we can get along one night
without them.”</p>

<p>“Ordinarily, yes,” her mother answered, promptly.
even on her husband. “Ordinarily, most certainly.
But there are these awful burglars, and we haven’t
a man in the house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s George, mamma,” suggested Clara. But
George with great promptness, spoke over his shoulder,
as old coachmen have a way of doing:</p>

<p>“Please, mem, I’ve got to be ‘ome to-night, because
o’ my wife h’end the baby as she h’expects.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Graham, slowly, “George is right;
he must be at home. Could your Cousin Will come,
do you think, Clara?&mdash;No: he’s away, too. There’s
Mr. Frisbie; we might ask him to take care of us.
No sensible burglars would think of robbing the parsonage.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t suppose they would,” answered Clara.
“But then Mr. Frisbie wouldn’t leave Mrs. Frisbie
and the little baby alone. And then suppose the burglars
were not sensible&mdash;”</p>

<p>“They must be,” said Mrs. Graham, with decision,
“or they wouldn’t have broken into the Marmadukes’
house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma,” suggested Clara, “couldn’t we telegraph
to somebody to come out to us? We might have
a messenger-boy sent out, or two or three, if you
wanted.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a boy, miss,” said George, the coachman.
“’E might take care o’ ye, mem, over night.”</p>

<p>But when she found that George’s boy was only
nine years old, Mrs. Graham shook her head.</p>

<p>“He’s too young. And I do not want messenger-boys.
They would be so slow, and they wear great
rubber trousers and always have their hands in their
pockets.” This was said very slowly and thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“We might telegraph to some friend in the city,
mamma,” suggested Clara. “He could come out on
the ten o’clock train, and get here before eleven. I
don’t suppose the burglars would come before
eleven.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. They never come before eleven o’clock,”
said Mrs. Graham, as decidedly as though she had
served an apprenticeship with a burglar and knew all
the rules governing his entrance into the best houses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
The idea of telegraphing to a friend evidently pleased
her. “We might telegraph to&mdash;to&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We might telegraph to Dr. Pennington,” suggested
Clara, with just the suspicion of a blush. “He
would be sure to come.”</p>

<p>Her mother did not notice the blush, and was evidently
considering the question of telegraphing. Just
then the carriage turned in at the Grahams’ gate.</p>

<p>“We must telegraph,” said Mrs. Graham, nodding
her head with great decision. “Yes, we must telegraph,
and to Dr. Pennington.”</p>

<p>It was later than usual that evening when Dr. John
Pennington dropped into the little French restaurant
near his office, to which his bachelorhood doomed him,
and, as almost every one else had gone, he was forced
to eat a solitary meal. As he looked carelessly
through an evening paper which he had taken up to
pass the time, he happened to notice the following
bit of news:</p>

<p>“The village of Marston is very much excited over
several burglaries committed there recently. The residence
of E. L. Marmaduke, a wealthy merchant of
New York City, was entered on Tuesday night, and
a large quantity of jewelry and silver stolen. Last
night, after visiting several houses with little success,
the burglars broke into the railroad-station. Many
commutation tickets had been renewed the day before,
and the burglars secured nearly two hundred
dollars in money. There are supposed to be three men
in the gang. No clue to them has yet been found.”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” thought the doctor, as he slowly sipped
his coffee, “I wonder if they have been to the Grahams’
yet. If they have, I’ll wager a large amount&mdash;I’d
go as high as my last year’s professional income&mdash;that
Mrs. Graham is now in a state of violent hysterics.
If they haven’t, she has at least sufficient material
to keep her in a state of worry for about one
year.” He finished his coffee. “I believe I’ll run
out to Marston to-morrow,” he continued, thoughtfully;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
“that is, if I’m not too much occupied.” (Pennington
religiously made this reservation, though
since he had become a doctor he had never been too
much occupied.) “I haven’t been there for a long
time, and the burglaries will give me a good excuse
for leaving my patients.”</p>

<p>Having made this determination, he dismissed the
matter from his mind, and, finishing his coffee, sat in
silence till he had smoked his cigar. Then he went
home to take up his usual task of waiting for patients.
When he reached his rooms, he found Mrs. Graham’s
telegram on his table. It was as enigmatical as
women’s communications generally are, and was
worded thus:</p>

<p>“Will you kindly take ten-o’clock train and spend
night with us? Will explain on arrival.”</p>

<p>“Spend the night? Will explain on arrival? What
on earth can the woman mean?” cried the doctor.
“Can any of the family be sick, I wonder? If so,
why should she send for me, when there must be other
doctors near by? No: that can’t be the reason.” But,
as he could think of no other explanation, he accepted
this one as the most plausible, and decided to take
his case of medicines with him to Marston. Looking
at his watch, he saw that he could barely catch the
train, and hastily began to pack his handbag. Then,
telling his landlady that he would be back in the
morning, he called a cab, and reached the station with
five minutes to spare.</p>

<p>A night ride in an accommodation train is not exciting,
and Pennington’s trip to Marston was monotonous
enough. He did not dare to read by the villainous
light, and so he devoted his time to speculating
on Mrs. Graham’s telegram. He stepped from the
train at Marston, however, without having come to
any definite conclusion on the subject.</p>

<p>“I think, sir,” said an elderly coachman, stepping
up to the young doctor and touching his hat, “I think
you must be the gentl’n h’expected at the Grahams’.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Will you step this way, sir? I ‘ave the buggy ‘ere.
These burglaries are h’awful, ain’t they, sir?” he began,
as he touched up the little mare.</p>

<p>“Burglaries?” said Pennington. “Oh, yes, I did
read about some burglaries up here&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the man, “an’ Mrs. Graham is
just scared out o’ her senses, sir, an’ when she got the
telegram from Mr. Graham, sir,&mdash;come up, Jess,&mdash;sayin’
that neither he nor Mr. Phil ‘ud be up to-night,
she sent for you ‘t once. Ye see, sir,” he continued,
waxing confidential, “I’m out o’ the runnin’, on account
o’ the visitor h’expected at my ‘ouse to-night.”</p>

<p>For the first time it dawned upon the doctor that
it was not for his professional services that he was
wanted, but more heroic ones, and he wished that he
had left his case of medicines at home. Old George,
however, gave him little time for thought, but entertained
him with accounts, partly real, partly fictitious,
of the daring and ferocity of the burglars who infested
the village, until the doctor began to wish that
Mrs. Graham had been able to secure any other protector
than himself.</p>

<p>As the carriage rolled up to the house, the door
opened, and Mrs. Graham, evidently on the watch,
rushed out.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dr. Pennington!” she cried, excitedly. “You
can’t tell how glad I am to see you! I <i>hope</i> you don’t
think it presuming in me to send for you?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” began Pennington, getting out of the
carriage; but Mrs. Graham noticed his medicine-case,
and interrupted him.</p>

<p>“You’ve brought your pistols,” she exclaimed.
“How splendid of you to think of them!”</p>

<p>“Do not for one instant think that you presumed
in sending for me,” said Pennington, as he ran lightly
up the steps and took Mrs. Graham’s outstretched
hand. “You know, Mrs. Graham, that it can only be
a pleasure to me to be of any service to you or Miss
Clara.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is very good of you, I’m sure, and I shall never
forget it; but now come right into the library. Clara
will be delighted to see an old friend who has come
in time of need. It was she who suggested sending
for you,” added Mrs. Graham, and Pennington
blushed with pleasure. “It’s very strange,” went on
the lady, “that Clara isn’t half so worried about the
burglars as I am, when it generally takes so much
to worry me. Clara, here is Dr. Pennington, pistols
and all; wasn’t it good of him to come?” she concluded,
as she entered the library. Clara came forward
to greet Pennington, blushing slightly, and looking
so charming that he felt he would be glad to have
the burglars come, that he might have the pleasure
of defending her.</p>

<p>“I have just told Mrs. Graham, Miss Clara,” said
Pennington, “that the goodness is all on her side.
You can’t realize how pleasant it is to see you again.
As for my pistols,” he added, carefully laying down
his medicine-case, “it overwhelms me with mortification
to confess that I have left the key of my case
behind.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is best that you did,” said Mrs. Graham,
while Clara laughed.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that, Dr. Pennington,” she
said, tapping the case lightly. “Wait a moment, and
I will bring something that will do as well as the pistols
you have here.” And she ran from the room.
When she returned, Mrs. Graham was insisting that
Pennington should take something to eat.</p>

<p>“Here is a weapon,” cried Clara, gaily, holding up
an old-fashioned muzzle-loading horse-pistol. She
handed it to Pennington, who colored as he took it.
“I think that will frighten the burglars,” she panted,
looking at Pennington and laughing.</p>

<p>“Clara,” said Mrs. Graham, “I wouldn’t have that
thing fired off in the house for the world. Your father
fired it off once at a cat, and the noise it made gave me
a nervous shock I didn’t get over for a week. Besides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
it brought in all the neighbors,&mdash;and some of them
were very common people,&mdash;who thought we had had a
dynamite explosion here.”</p>

<p>“But this ancient fire-arm has no hammer,” said
Pennington, after examining it. “A pistol without a
hammer, Mrs. Graham, is like a man without a head,&mdash;comparatively
useless.”</p>

<p>“My ignorance of such things,” said Mrs. Graham,
with a shudder, “is something stupendous, and I hope
you won’t laugh at me when I ask what the hammer of
a pistol is?”</p>

<p>“Let me show you, mamma,” cried Clara, jumping
up and taking the pistol from Pennington’s hands.</p>

<p>“Be careful, Clara, be careful,” cried Mrs. Graham,
evidently alarmed at its proximity. “Are you quite
sure that it won’t go off by itself?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure,” answered the doctor. But Mrs. Graham’s
fears could not be allayed until Pennington had
placed the pistol on the bookcase. She gave a sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>“I am sure that we shall not need a pistol,” said
Pennington, “for burglars never come where they are
expected.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps that is so,” answered Mrs. Graham. “I
know that I am awfully timid about them. But, doctor&mdash;could
you&mdash;would you&mdash;do you mind sleeping on
this lounge to-night?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” cried Pennington. “Why, Mrs.
Graham, it looks extremely comfortable.”</p>

<p>“It is very comfortable,” said Clara, giving it a little
pat by way of enforcing her remark. “It is quite
out of the ordinary run of lounges. I often take
naps on it myself.”</p>

<p>“That settles it,” cried Pennington. “Now not even
wild horses could drag me to a bed of ease.”</p>

<p>“I am very grateful to you,” said Mrs. Graham,
who did not look upon the matter as a trifling sacrifice
for the doctor to make. “I think we can make you
comfortable, however.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course you can, Mrs. Graham; and then just
think of the fame that awaits me if the burglars do
come. Why, the papers will be full of me. ‘Dr. Pennington
defends two helpless ladies from desperate
burglars. His only weapon a horse-pistol without a
hammer,’ and so on.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you can joke about such horrid
men; the very thought of them makes me shudder. But
we mustn’t keep you up all night, doctor. It is long
after eleven. Clara, take my hand; you couldn’t persuade
me to go up the stairs by myself. Doctor, would
you mind standing in the hall till we get to our
rooms&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Like the White Knight and Alice,” laughed Clara.
“You remember he asked Alice to wait till he was out
of sight, because her presence would cheer him&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Clara, you saucy girl!” cried her mother. “Doctor,
I will send Bridget down to make up a bed on the
lounge. Good night,” she called again, as she reached
her room.</p>

<p>“Don’t treat the poor burglars too cruelly, Dr. Pennington,”
cried Clara, looking over the baluster, and
then with a laugh she vanished.</p>

<p>“I wonder what she meant by that,” thought Pennington,
as he went back to the library. In a minute
Bridget appeared with sheets and blankets, and in a
short time had made up a bed on the broad lounge.
Then she departed and Pennington was left alone.</p>

<p>“Suppose the burglars should come,” he thought,
as he prepared to turn in. “But it’s not likely they
will. At any rate, I mustn’t let my imagination run
away with me; so here goes.” And with that he
turned out the gas and settled himself on the lounge,
where, in spite of discomforts present and burglars to
be, he was soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>He had been asleep, it seemed to him, for hours,
when he suddenly sat up, wide awake in an instant.
Had he dreamed that he had heard footsteps at the
back of the house, or was there really some one moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
about? Pennington listened with every nerve strained
to its utmost tension. There it goes again! He was
sure he heard a noise. It came from the dining-room&mdash;and
it sounded like the rattling of silver.</p>

<p>“They’re here,” he muttered, and drew a long breath.
“What in thunder am I to do? Ah! I’ll get that old
pistol and use the poker as a hammer; the old thing has
a cap on it.” Crawling softly from the lounge, he
groped his way towards the fireplace. The room was
as dark as a pocket, and before he had finished his uncertain
journey he struck his foot smartly against the
coal-scuttle. It rattled. He made a dive to stop it
from falling, and in so doing upset it. It fell with a
crash loud enough, it seemed to him, to wake the Seven
Sleepers.</p>

<p>Despite the pain of his stubbed foot, Pennington did
not hug his injured member with the affection usually
displayed on such occasions but ground his teeth and
listened intently for any sign from the burglars that
they had heard him.</p>

<p>A moment of suspense; then he assured himself that
they had heard nothing, and, securing pistol and
poker, started for the library door. He reached it
safely, and, opening it noiselessly, looked out into the
hall. A narrow streak of light from the partly-opened
dining-room door showed him where to steer,
and, grasping the poker firmly in his right hand and
the pistol in his left, he tiptoed across the hall.
The rattling of silver in the dining-room continued,
and almost drowned the nearer and solemn tick of
an old eight-day clock, whose brass and iron nerves
the doctor envied.</p>

<p>Creeping cautiously to the door, he looked through
the crack. The light was turned half on in the dining-room.
At the farther end of the room, with his back
turned towards him, was an old man, who seemed to be
taking silver from the drawers of the sideboard and
putting it into a basket at his side.</p>

<p>“The old villain!” thought Pennington. “How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
cool he is! I wonder where the other two fellows are.
Somewhere at hand, I suppose.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the burglar turned half around, as though
he were about to leave the room. Pennington shrank
back.</p>

<p>“I can’t shoot the fellow in cold blood,” he said to
himself. Just then his hand touched the knob of a
door which he knew opened into a large closet. An
idea struck him. He opened the door very quietly, and
then, picking up the rug from the hall floor, was ready
to carry out his plan.</p>

<p>The burglar was nearing the door. “Come up as
soon as you can,” he said, and as a muffled voice from
somewhere answered, “All right,” he opened the door
and stepped into the hall.</p>

<p>With a bound Pennington threw the heavy rug over
the man’s head, deftly twisting it so that he could
make no sound to warn his comrades. But the doctor
had not thought of the basket of silver which the man
carried, and it fell to the floor with a crash. There was
a quick movement in the direction from which the answering
voice had come, and a scream from upstairs.
Pennington fairly hurled his prisoner into the closet
and locked the door; then he stood a moment uncertain
whether to run upstairs to the aid of Mrs. Graham and
Clara or search for the other burglar. Suddenly he
heard a step behind him. Before he could turn he received
a blow on the side of his head. He fell to the
floor, where he lay half stunned. Then his hands were
tied behind him, and he felt himself picked up by his
assailant and held a moment uncertainly in mid air.</p>

<p>“Put him in here, Fred,” said a voice, and, to his
horror, Pennington heard the key turn in the lock, and
the next instant he was thrown into the closet with as
little ceremony as he had himself used towards the
burglar. Then the door was locked.</p>

<p>A sudden cough from the burglar made Pennington’s
hair stand on end, and he shivered when he heard
the man, sputtering and coughing, feeling audibly for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
what Pennington knew was his revolver. He was as
brave as most men, and at once determined not to lie
still at the mercy of a desperate ruffian. Very cautiously
he tried to pull his hands out of the bonds that held
them. To his joy, he found that the hastily-tied knots
would give way at a little straining.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, upstairs, Mrs. Graham and Clara had
gone to bed together for additional safety. Clara did
not tell her mother, but to herself confessed that she
had every confidence in Dr. Pennington, and so went
calmly to sleep. Mrs. Graham was less confident
than her daughter, and her sleep was light and broken.
The consequence was that the fall of the silver basket
woke her up instantly. She gave a scream.</p>

<p>“Clara!” she cried, shaking her daughter. “Clara,
the burglars are here!”</p>

<p>“Where?” demanded Clara, sitting bolt upright,
and looking in bewilderment out from the mist of her
long brown hair.</p>

<p>“Down stairs,” said Mrs. Graham, in a hoarse whisper.
“Help me, Clara, and scream.” With that she
set the example by uttering a shriek that rang through
the house, waking the servants in their rooms. Clara
sprang from the bed, and, scarcely knowing what she
did, began piling all the movable furniture in front of
the door, while her mother uttered scream after scream
with the regularity of a piece of clock-work.</p>

<p>There was a step in the hall, then another.</p>

<p>“There are two of them!” gasped Mrs. Graham, in
an interval of screaming. The door was opened slightly.
“Push up the bedstead, Clara!” and the two women
pushed the heavy piece of furniture against the
door. The movement was so sudden that the door
closed upon the intruder’s fingers. There was a howl
of pain.</p>

<p>“Scream!” commanded Mrs. Graham, as Clara
caught her by the arm. The girl did not at once obey.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother,” she cried, “what do you suppose
they’ve done to John&mdash;I mean Dr. Pennington?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let me in,” cried a voice in the hall. “Let me
in.” The two women screamed again. The door was
pushed open and a man’s head and shoulder thrust in.
In desperation, Mrs. Graham picked up the water-pitcher.
Rushing towards the man, she threw it at
him. It struck the wall and broke, near enough to him
to drench him.</p>

<p>“Hold on, I say!” he cried. “Mother, what are
you doing? Are you hurt? Have those scoundrels
hurt you?”</p>

<p>“Phil!” cried Mrs. Graham and Clara at once.
“Phil! Why, what are you doing here? How did you
come?” And they rushed upon him, dragging him
through the narrow opening and embracing him rapturously.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” asked Mrs. Graham
again, as she released him. He could not answer at
once, but after Clara had let him go, he answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, father at first forgot all about the burglars.
We were at the library, working away like beaver lawyers,
when he suddenly thought of ‘em. He jumped
up and said we must come right home, because you’d
be scared out of your wits.” Here he kissed his mother
again. “So we bundled up the papers, and, as we
were too late for the ten o’clock train, we came up on
the other road, and walked across. We brought Fred
with us, too.”</p>

<p>“Fred Austin?” asked Mrs. Graham. Phil nodded,
and went on:</p>

<p>“Father was sure you’d be awake, but you didn’t
seem to be, so we looked around, and pretty soon got
in through the front window, which was open.” Mrs.
Graham looked frightened. “Then we felt sure there
was something to pay, especially when we saw the silver
basket and the silver scattered around on the table
and sideboard, and the safe open, so father picked up
the silver, while Fred and I ran into the kitchen.”
Mrs. Graham had gasped when she heard of their discovery,
and stood listening with almost tragic intentness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>“We found no one there, but we heard a crash in
the hall and ran back. Fred came through the door
into the pantry, while I came by the dining-room. First
thing I knew I heard somebody fall in the hall, and
then Fred called me. He’d found a big fellow standing
by the door, evidently waiting for me, and he’d hit
him pretty hard on the head. Then we tied his hands
with a handkerchief and threw him into the closet.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Graham, looking relieved, while
Clara drew a long breath, “that was good. Where is
your father. Bring them both here.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t father here?” asked Phil. “Why, he came
upstairs first&mdash;has that scoundrel touched him, I wonder?”
And Phil darted out of the room and down-stairs.</p>

<p>“Then there was some one in the house,” said Mrs.
Graham, “for Phil said that Fred had to strike some
one.”</p>

<p>“Mamma,” said Clara, tremulously, seizing her
mother’s arm, “Fred hit Dr. Pennington!” And she
looked at her mother with wide-open eyes of alarm.
Mrs. Graham went into the hall, her daughter following
her.</p>

<p>“Be still!” commanded Mrs. Graham, opening the
door into the servants’ hall. “Girls, I’m ashamed of
you! Bridget, Eliza! Be still at once!” Her voice
had its effect, and the house became quiet again.</p>

<p>Meantime the two prisoners in the closet had not been
idle. Pennington at first lay where he had been thrown,
noiselessly trying to slip his hands through his bonds.
The burglar had evidently rid himself of the rug, and
Pennington could hear him groping his way about the
closet, now and again colliding with unknown obstacles.
He was nearing the prostrate doctor, who redoubled
his efforts to free himself. Suddenly the burglar’s
foot struck smartly against Pennington’s head.
The man stopped and drew back; then he pushed his
foot forward again till it once more touched the doctor.
Pennington, who had not quite freed himself when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
burglar first collided with him, jerked his hands out of
their fastenings, and, springing to his feet, aimed a
blow in the direction in which he thought the burglar
stood. He missed his aim in the darkness and bruised
his knuckles against the wall.</p>

<p>“Whew!” he cried, jumping with pain. Just then
he got a blow from the burglar on his shoulder. He
turned on him, but caught his foot on the rug and fell
at full length. He sprang up in an instant, however,
picking up the rug as he did so, and stood prepared to
defend himself as long as possible.</p>

<p>“Have you found your father?” asked Mrs. Graham,
leaning over the baluster and looking into the
darkness of the lower hall.</p>

<p>“Not yet, Mrs. Graham,” answered a voice.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you light the gas, Fred?” asked Mrs.
Graham, impatiently. There was a scratching of a
match, and in an instant the hall was lighted. Just
then Phil Graham came from the dining-room.</p>

<p>“I can’t find father,” he said anxiously.</p>

<p>Clara came timidly half-way down the stairs.</p>

<p>“Fred,” she asked, “what sort&mdash;who was it you
struck?”</p>

<p>“A tall man, standing here. He was waiting for
us to come out of the dining-room; but I came up behind
and hit him&mdash;so,” answered Fred Austin, with
some pride.</p>

<p>“Lucky he did, too,” said Phil. “The fellow had
this,” he added, holding up a pistol. Then, in a tone
of astonishment, he cried, “Hello! it’s father’s old
horse-pistol!”</p>

<p>Clara flew down the stairs to her brother, her long
hair streaming behind her. “It wasn’t a burglar!”
she cried. “It wasn’t a burglar! Why did you strike
him?” turning fiercely upon Fred Austin, and then
bursting into tears of terror.</p>

<p>Mrs. Graham followed her down. “He wasn’t a
burglar,” she explained to the perplexed young men.
“It was Dr. Pennington. He came down here to protect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
us while you were away. He must have heard you
and taken you for burglars, and you took him for one,
and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Pennington!” echoed Phil, while Fred looked at
Clara, with admiration and contrition, the former real,
the latter half feigned. “I put Pennington, if it was
he, into the closet,” he added, stepping towards the
place. Clara was before him, however.</p>

<p>The sound of voices in the hall had already attracted
the attention of the two prisoners. The burglar
groaned as he heard them, and his groan was fatal to
him, for it indicated that he was in the middle of the
closet. Instantly the doctor turned and threw the rug
in the direction of the sound. His aim was good, and
in a moment he had the burglar’s head again enveloped.
His hands were free, however, and he grappled
with Pennington so vigorously that he had much ado
to defend himself. Suddenly he gave the burglar a
strong shove from him. At that moment the door was
flung open.</p>

<p>“John,” cried Clara. The burglar fell through the
door into the hall. For an instant there was silence.
Then the burglar began to kick violently and to shout.</p>

<p>“It’s father!” cried Phil Graham, as he made a
dive for the half-smothered man and set him on his
feet. Mr. Graham looked around wildly for an instant
as he got rid of the rug.</p>

<p>“There’s a burglar in there!” he cried. “Shut the
door. Quick, shut the door!” And he threw himself
against it, refusing to move until Fred Austin had
locked it. “Whew!” he gasped. “The scoundrel!
Have you locked it Fred?&mdash;Tried to garrote me&mdash;whew!”
And he wiped his face and looked around on
his astonished family.</p>

<p>“Why, how did you get in there, father?” asked
Phil, while Mrs. Graham led her husband to a chair.
Clara stood still near the door.</p>

<p>“I was going up stairs with the silver basket, which
the burglar had left on the sideboard&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” interrupted his wife, penitently: “I told
Eliza I would put the silver in the safe myself, and I
was doing it when Dr. Pennington came. I ran out to
meet him, and forgot all about the silver. I don’t believe
there was any burglar at all.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there was,” said Mr. Graham, sturdily. “As
I was coming out of the dining-room, a fellow threw
this rug over me, and then threw me, rug and all, into
the closet. Presently he came in after me, I suppose to
remove the only witness against him. He was choking
me when you opened the door, and I broke away from
him.” And Mr. Graham pointed to the closet door.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s where we put Pennington,” cried
Austin and Phil Graham. Clara darted to the door
and opened it wide.</p>

<p>“John!” she cried again. “Come out, come out.”
And, in obedience to her call, John Pennington came
out.</p>

<p>“Where’s that burglar?” he asked.</p>

<p>“There were three of them,” answered Mrs. Graham,
promptly. “We have got them all.” Pennington
looked around bewildered. He recognized Phil
Graham, and then saw Mr. Graham sitting in the hall
chair, the rug at his feet. His face fell.</p>

<p>“This was the burglar you captured,” said Mrs.
Graham; and Mr. Graham nodded.</p>

<p>“Who hit me, then?” demanded Pennington, rubbing
his head. Fred Austin seemed bashful about answering,
and Phil spoke up:</p>

<p>“We took you for a burglar and captured you, just
as you had captured father.”</p>

<p>“Then there were no burglars?” asked Pennington,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“No, there were no burglars,” answered Mrs. Graham.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Pennington, as he rubbed his head
again, “I suppose it’s all right, but it’s rather hard on
a well-meaning fellow&mdash;” And he smiled rather
weakly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s all right,” said Clara, unconsciously laying
her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“My dear,” said Mr. Graham to his wife some time
later, as they were in their room together, “my dear,
didn’t Clara call the doctor John?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think you noticed it,” answered Mrs. Graham.</p>

<p>“I did, though,” said Mr. Graham. “It seems to
me, though there were no burglars to take our silver,
that Pennington has taken our little woman’s heart.”</p>

<p>“Fair exchange is no robbery,” remarked Mrs. Graham;
and her husband looked at her, and nodded several
times as though something pleased him.</p>

<h2 class="p2">THE DOCTOR: AN OLD VIRGINIA FOX HUNTER.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dcn.jpg" width="100" height="119" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi120">NOW the doctor was a Southerner of the old
school. Nor was he merely a North Carolinan,
a Tennesseean, a Kentuckian or a
Georgian&mdash;not any, thank you! No; our friend
was a Virginian&mdash;a real, “old-fashioned, blue-blooded,
whole-souled, open-handed Virginian.” And
this he was by virtue of eight or nine generations
of forebears who had fought, physicked, speechified,
fox-hunted, raised negroes and tobacco, in that immortal
commonwealth. No day passed but the doctor, in
his simple fashion, unconsciously thanked God that he
was a Virginian. For did not virtue, valor, honor,
gallantry, select the Old Dominion in the days of the
Stuarts as their special depot, from whence, in modified
streams, these qualities might be diffused over the
less fortunate portions of the Western world? To the
unsophisticated Englishman, to the ignorant Frenchman
or German, an American is an American. If he is
not rampantly modern, sensationally progressive, and
furiously material, he is nothing at all. But the doctor
would scarcely ever speak or think of himself as an
American, except in the same sense as an Englishman
would call himself a European. The doctor was every
moment of the day, and every day in the year, a Virginian
above everything; and as I have already said,
he felt thereby that a responsibility and a glory above
that of other mortals had been conferred upon him by
the accident of his birth. I may add, moreover,
that he was unquestionably non-progressive, that he
was decidedly not modern, while to this day he is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
reactionary that the sound of a railway irritates him;
and finally, that he was, and I feel sure still is, eminently
picturesque.</p>

<p>The doctor was about sixty-five at the time of which
I write (not so very many years ago). He had never
set foot outside Virginia, and never wanted to. That
a country, however, or climate, or people, or scenery,
existed that could be mentioned in the same breath
with the old Cavalier colony, never for one moment
was accounted within the bounds of possibility by that
good and simple soul.</p>

<p>And yet, paradoxical as it may seem, the doctor was
proud of his descent from pure English stock. “None
of Scotch or Irish, or Scotch-Irish for me. No, I thank
you, sir.” “My folks,” he was fond of relating, “were
real English stock, who came over way back in early
colonial days, and settled on the York River. They
were kin to the nobility.” Whatever may have been
the accuracy of this last claim, the doctor’s patronymic
in Virginia genealogy was above reproach, and would
have secured him an <i>éntree</i> (had he owned a dress coat,
and had he felt a hankering after Eastern cities) into
those small exclusive coteries in transatlantic society
that still recognize birth as superior to wealth and
even intellect. I should not like it to be supposed that
my dear doctor, of whom I am excessively fond, was
given to blustering about either his State or his descent.
Your fire-eating, blowing, swaggering Southerner
belongs either to a lower social grade, to the more
frontier States of the South, or, to a greater degree
perhaps than either, to the fertile imagination of Yankee
editors and dime novelists. The doctor was a Virginian.
His thoughts and his habits, which were peculiar
and original, were simply those of Virginians
of his class and generation somewhat strongly emphasized.
He was just and unassuming, kindly and homely.
There was about him a delightful, old-fashioned, if
somewhat ponderous suavity of manner, that the rest
of the Anglo-Saxon race have long, long outgrown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Even to hear a married female who was not black addressed
as otherwise than “Madam” positively pained
him. As for the children, the doctor had a separate
greeting for every one of them, let his host’s quiver
be ever so full. Ay, and generally something more
than that; for the doctor’s capacious pockets were
known by the little ones to be almost as inexhaustible
in the way of chincapins, hickory-nuts and candy, as
his well-worn saddle-bags were of less inviting condiments.</p>

<p>The doctor’s belief in his country (and by his country
of course I mean Virginia) was the religion in
which he was born. He would never have dreamt of
intruding it on you. International comparisons he
could not make, for he had never been out of the State.
I feel perfectly sure, however, if the doctor had travelled
over every corner of the earth, that his faith was
of that fundamental description which was proof
against mere sights and sounds. He would have returned
to the shade of his ancestral porch, temporarily
staggered, perhaps, but still unconvinced that any
land or any people could compare with old Virginia.</p>

<p>The average American in London is a spectacle
which has in it nothing inharmonious; on the contrary,
in these days it is sometimes hard to distinguish him
from the native. To picture the doctor in London,
however, requires an effort of imagination from which
the intellect shrinks. Of one thing I am sure, and
that is, he would be very miserable. He would call in
vain for glasses of cold water like that from the limpid
spring under the poplar tree at home, of which the
doctor consumes about a horse-troughful a day. He
would hang over the apple-stalls, and groan over the
deficiencies of a country that could do no better than
that. He would get up two hours before the servants,
and prowl about disconsolate and hungry till breakfast.
What an apology, too, for a breakfast it would
be without an “Old Virginia hot-beat biscuit!” In his
despair of getting a “julep” he might take a whiskey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
punch before his early dinner. But here, again, how
could the emblazoned wine-card, with its, for him,
meaningless contents, supply the want of that big
pitcher of foaming buttermilk for which his simple
palate craves? The pomp and wealth, the glitter and
glare of a great capital, would be simply distasteful to
our patriarch. In his own land he and his have been
for all time aristocrats&mdash;after their own fashion, it is
true, but still aristocrats. They have been strongly inclined
to regard themselves as the salt of the earth&mdash;and
perhaps they are; a good sturdy British foible
this, intensified by isolation and the mutual admiration
atmosphere which isolation creates. At any rate,
gold lace and liveries and coronets are not indispensable
adjuncts of honor and breeding. The doctor, however&mdash;if
we can imagine him gazing on the stream of
carriages rolling past Hyde Park corner on a summer
evening&mdash;would be sensible, for the first time in his
life, to a feeling somewhat akin to insignificance creeping
over him. He would hate and despise himself for
it, but still it would make him uncomfortable, and he
would want to get away home. A depressing suspicion
would come over our good friend that the haughty
squires and dames knew no more of Virginia’s history,
or of Pages and Randolphs, and Pendletons
and Byrds, than they knew of the obscure
Elijahs and Hirams and Aarons that tilled the
stony fields of New England. I fear, moreover,
that the suspicion would be too well founded.
As a Cumberland squire in the eighteenth century
might have been disillusioned by a visit to the
the capital, so to a much greater degree would our good
Virginian friend have in all probability suffered by a
similar transportation. Once home again, however, I
can safely affirm of the doctor, that these uncomfortable
sensations would have vanished in no time. Once
more in his cane-bottomed rocking-chair on the shady
porch; once more within sight of the blue mountains,
the red fallows, and the yellow pine-sprinkled sedgefields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
of his native land, he would quickly recover from
the temporary shocks that had irritated him. The sublime
faith in “the grand old Commonwealth” would
return, and he would thank God more fervently than
ever he was a son of Virginia; not because of her present
or her future&mdash;for he considered the Virginia he
belonged to died with slavery&mdash;but on account of her
people and her past. The doctor, happily, had been
spared all these trials and his faith remained pure and
unimpaired. The only capital he had ever visited was
the charming little city of Richmond, where every
third man or woman he met was his cousin; where most
of society call one another by their Christian names,
dine in the middle of the day, and sit out on chairs in
the street after supper. Richmond is delightful, and
so are its people; but its atmosphere would tend to confirm,
not to shake, the doctor’s homely faith.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Southern States was the only part of
the world where the practice of medicine has ever been
looked upon as an honorable adjunct to the possession
of considerable landed estates and an aristocratic
name. As in England there were squire-parsons, so in
Virginia there were squire-doctors, men of considerable
property (as things go there) both in land and
slaves, regularly practising in their own neighborhood.
The slaves that constituted the bulk of their
wealth have gone, but the lands and the practice remain&mdash;for
those who still survive and are able to sit
upon a horse.</p>

<p>The doctor is one of these survivals&mdash;and may he
long flourish! He had only a moderate property&mdash;two
farms&mdash;of which we shall speak anon. But then he
was a Patton; and as everybody south of the Potomac
knows, the Pattons are one of the first families in the
State&mdash;none of your modern and self-dubbed F. F.
V.’s are they, but real old colonial people, whose names
are written on almost every page of their country’s history.
Besides this, Judge Patton, the doctor’s father,
was one of the greatest jurists south of Washington&mdash;”in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
the world,” Virginians said; but as a compromise
we will admit he was one of the first in America, and
quite distinguished enough to reflect a social halo over
his immediate descendants, supposing even they had
not been Pattons.</p>

<p>The original Patton mansion was burnt down in
1840. Nothing was left but the office in the yard,
where in those days our friend the doctor pursued his
youthful medical investigations and entertained his
bachelor friends. The judge was a busy man, and
much absent. He was always “laying out to build him
a new house;” but death “laid him out” while the
scheme was still in embryo. The doctor, who, as only son,
became proprietor, had his hands too full, what with
negroes, and farming, and physicking, and fox-hunting,
to carry it out till the war was upon him, and with
its results put an end, as he thought at the time, to
everything which makes life sweet.</p>

<p>It must not, however, be supposed that the doctor
and his father had gone houseless or camped out since
1840. Not at all. From the old brick office, whose isolation
had saved it from that memorable conflagration,
there had grown&mdash;I use the word advisedly, as applicable
to Virginia architecture&mdash;there had grown a rambling
structure, whose design, rather than whose actual
weight of years, gave it an appearance venerable
enough to command the respect and admiration of
summer tourists from New York and Philadelphia. It
was not often such apparitions passed that way, and
when they did, it was generally in pursuit of filthy
lucre suppositiously concealed in the fields or the forests.
Nor are mining prospectors as a rule sentimental,
but sometimes they are in America. When such <i>rarae
aves</i> came by the doctor’s front gate, they would almost
always pull up and gaze through it with that admiration
and respect that Northerners are inclined to
pay to anything in their own country that recalls the
past.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t that too quaint for anything!” the ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
who sometimes accompanied them never failed to remark.
“That’s a real old ramshackle Virginia house,
by thunder! and a pretty heavy old fossil inside it, you
bet!” said the more observant of the gentlemen.</p>

<p>The doctor would have gloried in such criticism had
he heard it. He hated Yankees; he hated your new-fangled
houses; he hated railroads; he hated towns;
he hated breech-loading guns; sights and sounds and
things that he was not familiar with at five-and-twenty
he would have none of when he was between sixty and
seventy.</p>

<p>The doctor’s house was unconventional, to be sure,
while weather and neglect of paint or whitewash had
given it an air of antiquity to which it had no real
claim. It lay a hundred yards back from the road, and
appeared to consist of four or five small houses of varying
dimensions, and occupying relationships toward
one another of a most uncertain kind. Two of these
leaned heavily together, like convivial old gentlemen
“seeing one another home.” The rest lay at respectful
distances from each other, connected only by open verandahs,
through which the summer breeze blew freshly,
and lovingly fanned the annuals that spread and
twined themselves along the eaves. Almost every style
of Virginia rural architecture found places in this
homely conglomeration of edifices, which even “old
man Jake,” the negro, who has for twenty years looked
after the doctor’s horses and stolen his corn, described
as “mighty shacklin’, and lookin’ like as if they’d bin
throwed down all in a muss.”</p>

<p>It was, however, a real old characteristic Virginia
house of its kind. There were squared chestnut logs,
black with rain and sun, against which the venetian
shutters of the windows banged and thumped in gusty
spring days as against walls of adamant. These same
logs were got out of the woods and squared, the doctor
would tell you, in days “when men had plenty of
time and plenty of force (<i>i. e.</i>, slaves) to do those
things properly.” Then there were walls of pine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
weather-boarding, erected at a period when, the same
authority would inform you, “people began to saw and
season their lumber five or ten years before they started
to build.” There were roofs of wooden shingles
slanting and sloping in every direction&mdash;black, rotting,
and moss-grown here, white and garish there, where
penetrating rains had forced the slow and reluctant
hand of repair. Dormer-windows glared out at you,
patched as to their shattered panes with local newspapers
of remote date, and speaking of stuffy attics behind,
where hornets, yellow-jackets and “mud-daubers”
careered about in summer-time over the apple-strewn
floors. Then there was the old brick office&mdash;relic
of a distant past; of a period when the Virginia
planters, though surrounded by the finest clay, were so
absorbed in tobacco that they sent to England for their
bricks. It is probable, however, that these particular
bricks were produced upon the spot. At any rate, their
comparative antiquity and presumably mellow tone
have been ruthlessly effaced, for this is the only part
of the doctor’s mansion that he has selected for a coat
of whitewash. It is used for professional purposes,
and is known by the doctor’s patients as the “sujjery.”
I know it is hopeless to try, by a bald description
of timber and bricks and mortar, to give any idea
of how the doctor’s rambling homestead appealed to
the sense of the picturesque, and to the affections of
those of us who were familiar with it and with its inmate.
No doubt, however, the latter had something to
do with this. Nor should the surroundings be forgotten.
The stately oaks that towered high above the
quaint low buildings, and covered with leaves and
dèbris the greater portion of that domestic enclosure
which in those parts was known as the yard. The
straggling, branching acacias that grew close to the
house, and spread their tall arms above the roof, littering
it in autumn with showers of small, curly leaves,
and choking the wooden gutters (for the doctor considered
tin piping as a modern heresy) with fragmentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
twigs. The fresh, green turf that had matted and
spread for one hundred and fifty years around this
house and the more stately one that preceded it. The
aged box-trees that had once, no doubt, in prim Dutch
rows lined some well-tended gravel path, but now
cropped up here and there upon the turf, like beings
that had outlived their time and generation. The clustering
honeysuckles, bending their old and rickety
frames to the ground. The silver aspens before the
door, whose light leaves shivered above your head in
the most breathless August days. The slender mimosa,
through whose beautiful and fragile greenery the first
humming-birds of early June shyly fluttered; and the
long row of straw hives against the rickety fence,
where hereditary swarms of bees&mdash;let well alone&mdash;made
more honey than the doctor and all his neighbors
could consume.</p>

<p>Yes! These objects are, and all and many more are,
twined around my heart, but the doctor’s front gate
occupies no such position at all. It was all very well
for the people who stopped in the road and looked
through its bars at the fine old oaks, the green lawn
beyond, and the quaint, straggling structure, and then
drove on their way. For those, however, whose duty
or pleasure compelled them to penetrate that barrier,
it was entirely another matter. It was a home-made
gate&mdash;a real “old Virginia” gate&mdash;put up at the close
of the war as a protest, it would almost seem, against
Yankee notions of hurry. To look at the tremendous
portal, you would have supposed that the doctor was
the most defiant recluse, instead of the most hospitable
of men. It was, however, a typical Virginia gate
strongly emphasized, just as the doctor was a typical
Virginia gentleman strongly emphasized. I couldn’t
speak accurately as to its dimensions, but I have often
had to jump for life as it fell, and from the way in
which it hit the ground, I should say that it must have
weighed nearly a thousand pounds. Its weight would
have been of no importance whatever to anyone but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the doctor and the posts which supported it, had it
been properly hung with two hinges and a latch. No
doubt it had commenced life with these advantages;
but during all the years I struggled with it, there was
no latch, and only a bottom hook-hinge. It was kept in
its place by two ponderous fence rails being leaned up
against it. The most elementary mathematician will at
once arrive at the result which ensued on the removal
of these rails (a herculean task in itself) and the
opening of the gate, unless extraordinary skill was exercised.
It was really a performance beyond a single
man; so most visitors, unless they were “riding for the
doctor”&mdash;in the most serious business sense&mdash;holloaed
for assistance, or rode about till some of the hands
came up to the rescue. It must not be supposed that
the doctor’s establishment, though strongly typical in
a sense, resembled to any extent the real old Virginia
mansion. The Pattons, it will be remembered, had
been burnt out, and the present pile had been originally
intended only as a makeshift; but it was such a
makeshift as would perhaps be seen nowhere out of
Virginia. Of the more substantial family mansions
there were plenty crowning the hills in the doctor’s
neighborhood. Square blocks of brick, some many-windowed
and green-shuttered, with huge Grecian porticoes
supported by rows of white fluted pillars stretching
along their face. Great big wooden barns, others
with acres of roof and rows of dormer-windows, and
crazy, crumbling porches, and stacks of red brick chimneys
clambering up outside the white walls at the gable
ends, or anywhere else where they came handy for that
matter. There were plenty of these within range of
the doctor’s house and the limits of his practice, and
to the proprietor of every one the doctor was related.
The stages of this relationship varied from the unquestioned
affinity of cousins and nephews, to that which
is described in Virginia by the comprehensive and farreaching
appellative of “kin.” To be kin of the Pattons,
moreover, was in itself a desirable thing in Virginian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
eyes. Though the doctor lived in such an unpretentious
residence, and worked day in and day out
as a country practitioner, there were people in the
neighborhood holding their heads pretty high, who
were always pleased to remember that their father’s
first cousin had married the doctor’s mother’s brother.</p>

<p>With all the doctor’s quaint ideas and strong prejudices,
I have said that he was a thorough gentleman.
He was of the kind meant for use, and not for show.
Good Heavens! What would your dashing British
Æsculapius, in his brougham or well-appointed dog-cart,
have said to my old friend’s appearance when
setting out for a long winter day’s work? I can see
him now, riding in at the gate on some wild January
day, bringing hope in his kindly face, and good conservative,
time-honored drugs in his well-worn saddle-bags.
A woollen scarf is drawn round his head, and
on the top of it is crammed an ancient wide-awake. A
long black cloak, fastened round his throat with a
clasp, and lined with red flannel, falls over the saddle
behind. His legs, good soul, are thickly encased in
coils of wheat straw, wound tightly round them from
his ankles upwards. In his hand, by way of a whip, he
carries a bushy switch plucked from the nearest tree,
and upon one heel a rusty spur that did duty at Bull’s
Run.</p>

<p>Now do not suppose that the doctor on such occasions
was regarded as a scarecrow, or that his neighbors
looked upon him as eccentric or even careless of
attire; on the contrary, this was a good old Virginia
costume. The doctor’s appearance as above described
was not the desperate expedient of a frontier and transitory
condition&mdash;not at all. It was a survival of two
hundred years of a peculiar civilization; a civilization
that had been wont to look inside the plantation fence
for almost every necessary; a patriarchal dispensation
whose simplicity was to a great extent the outcome of
exclusiveness; a social organization wherein each
man’s place was so absolutely fixed, that personal apparel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
was a matter of almost no moment, and personal
display, such as engages the well-to-do of other countries
in mischievous rivalry, was hardly known.</p>

<p>The general shabbiness of Virginia was not the temporary
shabbiness of a pioneering generation&mdash;that
condition everybody can understand&mdash;but the picturesque
and almost defiant tatterdemalionism of quite an
old and thoroughly self-satisfied community, unstimulated
by contact with the outer world. It was a mellow,
time-honored kind of shabbiness of which Virginians
are almost proud, regarding it as a sort of mute
protest, though an extreme one, against those modern
innovations which their souls abhorred. The doctor
had been a widower since the first year of the war. In
accordance with local custom, he had buried his wife
in the orchard. A simple marble shaft in that homely
quarter spoke of her virtues and her worth to the colts
and calves that bit the sweet May grass around her
tomb, and to the inquiring swine that crunched the rotting
apples as they fell in autumn from the untended
trees. Neither had the doctor been blessed with sons
or daughters. Who would he “’ar (heir as a verb)
his place to” was a common subject of discussion
among the negroes on the property. The doctor’s profession,
no doubt, was his first care; but his heart was
with his farms and his fox-hounds. The doctor had
practised over, or, as we used to say there, “ridden”
the south side of the country for nearly forty years.
He had studied medicine with the intention only of
saving the doctor’s bill in his father’s household of
eighty negroes. He had soon, however, dropped into
a regular practice, and for the last five-and-twenty
years, at any rate, no birth or death within a radius of
ten miles would have been considered a well-conducted
one without his good offices. The doctor’s income, upon
the well-thumbed scroll of hieroglyphics that he
called his books, was nearly three thousand dollars a
year. He collected probably about fifteen hundred. A
considerable portion, too, of this fifteen hundred was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
received in kind payments, not conveniently convertible,
such as bacon, Indian corn, hams, wheat flour,
woollen yarns, sucking pigs, home-made brooms, eggs,
butter, bricks, sweet-potato slips, sawn plank, tobacco-plants,
shingles, chickens, baskets, sausage-meat, sole-leather,
young fruit trees, rawhides, hoe-handles, old
iron. To utilize these various commodities, it would
have been necessary for the doctor to have had a farm,
even supposing he had not already been the fortunate
proprietor of two. Indeed, a farm to a Southern doctor
is not only necessary as a receptacle for the agricultural
curiosities that are forced upon him in lieu of
payment, but for the actual labor of those many dusky
patients who can give no other return for physic and
attendance received. You could see a bevy of these
Ethiopians almost any day upon the doctor’s farm,
wandering aimlessly about with hoes or brier-blades,
chattering and cackling and doing everything but
work.</p>

<p>The doctor might have been called a successful physician.
He had no rivals. There were two inferior
performers in the district, it is true, who were by way
of following the healing art&mdash;small farmers, who were
reported to have studied medicine in their youth. One
of these, however, had not credit sufficient to purchase
drugs, and the other was generally drunk. So it was
only their near relations, when not dangerously indisposed,
who patronized them&mdash;or some patient of the
doctor’s now and again, perhaps, who took a fancy the
latter was too “aristocratic,” till he got badly sick,
and returned with alacrity to his allegiance. There is
no doubt, I fear, but that the doctor practised on the
lines of thirty years ago. Tory to the backbone in
every other department of life, it was hardly to be expected
that he should have panted for light and leading
in that branch of learning in which he had no rival
within reach. Papers or magazines connected with the
healing science I never remember to have seen inside
the Patton homestead; and yet, after a great deal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
experience of the good old man’s professional care, I
have a sort of feeling that I would as soon place my
life in his hands as in the hands of Sir Omicron Pi!</p>

<p>What time the doctor had to spare from physicking,
I have said he devoted to farming and to fox-hunting.
I should like to follow him for a bit on his long professional
rounds, and listen to his cheery talk in homestead
and cabin; to help him fill his long pipe, which
he draws out of his top-boot when the patient has settled
down to sleep or quiet; to hear him once again
chat about tobacco and wheat, politics and foxes. I
should like, too, to say something of the doctor’s farming&mdash;heaven
save the mark&mdash;on his two properties; the
one “’ard” him by his father, and the other one, the
quarter place near by, that “cum to him with his wife,
ole Cunnel Pendleton’s daughter.”</p>

<p>I must only pause to remark, however, that the doctor
farmed, as he did everything else, in the good old
Virginia fashion&mdash;or in what is now irreverently
known as the “rip and tar (tear) principle.” He
didn’t care anything about acres or estimates; and as
for farm books, his professional accounts pestered him
quite enough. Of rotations, he neither knew nor wanted
to know anything. His great idea was to plough
and sow as much land as he could scuffle over with all
the labor he could scrape together. Of manuring,
clovering, or fertilizing, he took little account. If he
“pitched” a big crop only, he was a proud and happy
man. When each recurring harvest brought results
more insignificant than the last, a temporary disgust
with the whole business used to seize on my old friend,
and he would swear that the wheat crops had been of
no account since the war; that tobacco had gone to the
devil, and that he’d quit fooling with a plantation for
good and all. In the eyes of those who knew him, however,
such tirades meant absolutely nothing. A Virginian
of his description could no more have helped
farming than he could have altered any other of the
immutable laws of nature. A younger generation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
many indeed of the older one, have learned wisdom
and prudence in the management of land since the
abolition of slavery. The doctor, however, and the
few left like him, will be land-killers of the genial
good old sort till they lie under the once generous sod
they have so ruthlessly treated.</p>

<p>The doctor’s first care was of necessity his patients;
but there is no doubt, I think, that his real affections
were divided between his farm and his fox-hounds.
That he did his duty by the former was amply testified
to by the popularity he enjoyed. That he signally
failed in the treatment of his lands was quite as evident.
For while he healed the sores and the wounds of
his patients, the sores, the wounds, the storm-rent gullies,
the bare galls in his hillsides, grew worse and
worse. The maize-stalks grew thinner, the tobacco
lighter, the wheat-yield poorer, year by year. One has
heard of famous painters, who perversely fancied
themselves rather as musicians&mdash;of established authors
who yearned rather to be praised as artists. So the
doctor, who certainly had no local rival in his own profession,
seemed to covet fame rather as the champion
and exponent of a happily departing school of Southern
agriculturists. In this case, the income derived
from the profession just sufficed to make good the
losses on the farm. So, though the doctor, in spite of
his household expenses being almost <i>nil</i>, could never
by any chance lay his hand on a five-dollar bill, he
managed to keep upon the whole pretty free from
debt. With a scattered practice, and an agricultural
hobby extending over one thousand acres, including
woods and old fields “turned out” to recover, it may
be a matter of surprise that our old friend had leisure
for a third indulgence, especially one like fox-hunting,
which is connected in the British mind with such a
large consumption of time. Nevertheless, the doctor,
like most of his compeers, was passionately fond of
the chase, and in spite of the war and altered times,
had kept hounds round him almost without a break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
since he was a boy. It will be seen, however, that fox-hunting,
as understood and followed by the doctor, was
by no means incompatible with his more serious avocations.</p>

<p>Now, if the fashion in which the doctor pursued
the wily fox was not orthodox from a Leicestershire
point of view, it was for all that none the less, perhaps
indeed so much the more, genuine. Around New York
and Philadelphia, it is true, the sport is pursued by
fashionable bankers, brokers, and lawyers in a style
the most approved. All the bravery and the glitter,
ay, and much of the horsemanship of the British hunting-field,
is there. But, like polo and coaching, it is
there as a mere exotic, transplanted but yesterday, to
the amazement and occasionally indignation of the
Long Island rustics and the delight of the society papers.
Everything is there&mdash;hounds, huntsmen, whips,
red coats, tops, splendidly mounted hard-riding ladies
and gentlemen, sherry-flasks, sandwich-boxes, etc., etc.,&mdash;everything,
in short, but the fox. So far, however,
as I can learn, such an omission is of no great importance
under the modern conception of hunting. That
wouldn’t be the doctor’s way of thinking at all, though;
for I must here remark, that that worthy sportsman’s
love of hunting is entirely on hereditary principles and
of native growth. Fox-hunting for two centuries has
been the natural pastime of the Virginia gentry. They
imported the chase of the fox and its customs from
the mother country at a period when such things were
conducted in a very different style from what they
are now.</p>

<p>The hunting of the fox, as carried on in England
early in the last century, let us say, offered, I take it,
a very different spectacle from that seen in the elaborate
and gorgeous cavalcades and the rushing fleet-footed
hounds that race to-day over the trim, well-trained
turf of the shires. No foxes were killed in
those days in twenty-five minutes, I’ll warrant. Men
started their fox at daybreak and pottered along, absorbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
in the performance of their slow hounds, over
the rushy, soppy, heathy country, from wood to wood,
for hours and hours. They were lucky then, no doubt,
if Reynard succumbed in time to admit of their punctual
appearance at that tremendous three o’clock orgie,
which the poet Thomson has so graphically laid before
us.</p>

<p>Amid the glitter, the show, the dash, the swagger of
modern fox-hunting, Englishmen who are not masters
of hounds or huntsmen are apt to lose sight of the original
ends and aims, the craft, and the science of the
sport. It seems to me that fox-hunting nowadays, with
the vast mass of its devotees, is simply steeplechasing
over an unknown course. This is unquestionably a
manly and a fine amusement, and far be it from me
to breathe a word against it. I only wish to anticipate
the sneers of your sporting stock-broker if he were to
catch sight of the doctor and his hounds upon a hunting
morning.</p>

<p>With the average Nimrod of modern days, I venture
then to assert that fox-hunting is only a modified form
of steeplechasing. With the Virginian, who is simply
a survival of other days, it is nothing of the kind. The
doctor knew nothing of bullfinches or double ditches,
of post and rails or five-barred gates, in a sporting
sense; but what he did not know about a fox was not
worth knowing at all. As for his hounds, he could tell
the note of each at a distance when the music of a
whole pack was scarcely audible to the ordinary ear.</p>

<p>As far as I remember, the doctor used generally to
keep about five couple of hounds. It is needless to say
he always swore they were the “best stock of fox-dogs
in the State.” Jim Pendleton, his cousin across the
hill, and Judge Massey, on the north side of the county,
who also kept hounds, were quite prepared to take an
affidavit of the same kind with regard to their own respective
packs. The doctor’s hounds lived as members
of the family. A kind of effort was spasmodically
made to keep them from appropriating the parlor, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
so long as the weather was mild, they were fairly content
to lie in the front porch, or in one of the many
passages which let the air circulate freely through the
Patton homestead.</p>

<p>If the weather was cold, however, and the doctor had
a fire in the parlor, the older and more knowing dogs
seldom failed eventually to gain a lodgment. By persistently
coming in at one door, and when kicked out
by the long-suffering M. F. H., slowly going round the
house and slyly entering at the other, they invariably
conquered in the long run, and established themselves
on the warm bricks of the hearth before the great
white-oak logs which blazed on the bright brass and irons.</p>

<p>Of course it was not often that the doctor and his
hounds were all at home together on a winter’s day.
If the latter were not hunting with him, they were out
upon their own account, for, be it noted, they were absolutely
their own masters, as is the way with Virginia
fox-hounds. If the doctor chose to accompany them
and do a great deal of tooting and some hallooing, I
have no doubt a certain amount of satisfaction animated
the breasts of the pack. But it made no difference
whatever to the sporting arrangements they had
planned among themselves, or to their general programme.
Whatever happened, they were bound to
have their hunt. As the doctor’s pride and joy was
not in his own performance in the pigskin&mdash;for he
never attempted any&mdash;but in the achievements of his
dogs, this want of discipline and respect was no drawback
whatever to his satisfaction.</p>

<p>I have said the doctor could combine his favorite
sport with the exercise of his profession. That is to
say, if he were going out in any likely direction, he
would manage to keep his hounds around him till he
had despatched his lamplight breakfast, and they
would all start together. The pack, moreover, was
easily increased, for the doctor had only to step around
to the back porch, which looked across the valley to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
Cousin Jim Pendleton’s place, and to blow lustily on
his tremendous cow-horn.</p>

<p>A very little of this music was sufficient to bring the
greater part of the rival pack scrambling in a half-guilty
way over the garden fence. After a little
growling and snarling and snapping, the strangers
would settle down among the doctor’s hounds as if
they had been raised on the place.</p>

<p>See the doctor attired for the chase emerging with
his hounds from that awful front gate of his, which is
being held up and open by the combined efforts of two
stalwart negroes. It is a mild and soft February morning,
at about the hour when the sun would be seen
mounting over the leafless woodlands to the east of
the house, if it were not for the dark banks of clouds
chasing one another in continuous succession from the
southwest. The doctor is not quite such a scarecrow
to-day. The weather is mild, and he has left the coils
of straw behind, having his stout legs encased in grey
homespun overalls, which he calls leggings. The long
Bull’s Run spur is on his left heel. The black cloak
with the red lining is on his back. The slouch hat
upon his head, and spectacles upon his nose. A high
standup collar of antique build and a black stock give
the finishing touch to a picture whose “old-timiness,”
as the Americans say, would have thrown a Boston
novelist into convulsions of ecstasy.</p>

<p>The doctor this morning is combining business with
pleasure. He has to visit the widow Gubbins, who fell
down the cornhouse steps the week before, and broke
her leg. But he has had word sent to him that there
is a red fox in the pine wood behind the parsonage,
hard by the Gubbins domicile. I need not say the saddle-bags
and the medicine bottles are there; but, besides
these, there is a great big cow-horn which the
doctor carries slung round him, and blows long blasts
upon as he goes “titupping” down the muddy lane.
These blasts are rather with a view of personal solace
than for any definite aims. The doctor loves the horn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
for its associations, and goes toot-tooting down the
soft red road, and waking the echoes of the woods and
fields solely for his own personal benefit and refreshment.
Hector and Rambler, Fairfax and Dainty, and
the rest&mdash;little wiry, lean fellows of about two-and-twenty
inches&mdash;hop over the big mudholes, or creep
around the dry fence corners waiting for the first bit
of unfenced woodland to trot over and commence the
day’s operations.</p>

<p>The doctor, however, is determined, if possible, to
keep them in hand till they reach the haunt of that
aforesaid red fox which is said to be lurking in the
parson’s wood. He hopes to be able to exercise authority
sufficient to keep these independent dogs of his
from getting on the trail of a ringing, skulking grey
fox in the first ivy thicket or open bit of forest they
come to. It is no manner of use, however. The rutty,
soppy road, soon after it leaves the doctor’s estate,
straggles unfenced through half a mile of mazy woodland.
Though it is a historic turnpike of old coaching
fame&mdash;a road the memory of whose once bustling
gaiety well-nigh brings tears to the eyes of the old inhabitants&mdash;it
is scarcely visible to the rare wagoner or
horseman in these degenerate times, from the wealth
of autumn leaves that hide its rugged face. Into the
wood plunge the eager and undisciplined hounds, the
dry leaves crackling and rustling under their joyous
feet as they scamper and race amid the tall oak and
poplar trunks, and one by one disappear beyond the
very limited horizon. The doctor toots and toots till
not only the forest but the hills and valleys beyond
echo to the appeals of the familiar cow-horn. Mighty
little, however, care the dogs for such tooting. They
look upon it as a harmless sign of encouragement, a
pleasant accompaniment to the preliminaries until the
more serious work begins. Nor do they care in the
least when the doctor drops his horn and begins to
halloo and shout and storm&mdash;not they. He might as
well shout and storm at the wind. The doctor gets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
very mad. He doesn’t swear&mdash;Virginians of his class
and kind very seldom do&mdash;but he uses all the forms of
violent exhortation that his conscience admits of, and
that belongs to the local vernacular. He calls the
whole pack “grand scoundrels and villains.” In a
voice grown husky with exertion, he inquires of their
fast-fading forms if they know “what in thunder he
feeds them for?” He roars out to little Blazer, the
only one left within good speaking distance that he’ll
“whale the life out of him;” whereupon little Blazer
disappears after the rest. So he finally confides to the
sorrel mare, which is ambling along under him at the
regulation five-mile-an-hour gait of the Southern roadster,
that these dogs of Cousin Jeems’ (the doctor says
“Jeems,” not because he doesn’t know any better, but
because it is a good old Virginia way of pronouncing
the name) are the hardest-headed lot of fox-dogs
south of the Potomac River.</p>

<p>But hark! There is a boom from the pine wood, the
deep green of whose fringe can be seen far away
through the naked stems and leafless branches of the
oaks. The doctor pulls up; he “concludes he’ll wait
awhile and see what it amounts to, any way.” The
scoundrels are probably fooling after a rabbit, or, at
the best, have struck the trail of a grey fox (the most
common native breed, that won’t face the open or run
straight). The doctor draws rein at the edge of the
wood, where the straggling forest road once more becomes
a highway, fenced in from fields of young
wheat, pasture and red fallow. He thinks the widow
Gubbins can wait a bit, and that old red fox at the
parson’s can lay over for another day.</p>

<p>“That’s old Powhatan, cert’n and sure; and that’s
a fox of some sort, I’ll sw’ar,” remarks our old friend
to the sorrel mare, which pricks up her ears as another
deep note comes echoing from the valley below.</p>

<p>It is late in February; and though February in Virginia
is practically the same dead, colorless, leafless,
budless, harsh winter month it is with us, yet there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
are sometimes days before it closes that seem to breathe
of a yet distant spring with more witching treachery
than the greatest effort that period can make in our
more methodical clime. And this is one of them. The
soft and balmy air is laden, it is true, with no scent of
blossoms or opening buds. The odor of smouldering
heaps of burning brush and weeds, or of tardily burnt
tobacco-plant beds, is all that as yet scents the breeze.
But after a month of frost and rain and snow and
clouds, the breath is the breath of spring, and the glow
of the sun, now bursting through the clouds, seems no
longer the sickly glare of winter. The soft Virginia
landscape, swelling in gentle waves of forest, field, and
fallow to the great mountains that lie piled up far
away against the western sky, is naked still and bare,
save for the splashes of green pine woods here and
there upon the land. But there is a light in the sky
and a feel in the air that seems almost to chide the
earth for its slow response. The blood courses quicker
through the veins of even easy-going Virginia farmers
at the thoughts of seeding-time. The negro’s head
comes up from under his shoulders and his hands from
his pockets, where they have each respectively spent
most of the winter, and the air becomes laden with
those peculiar dirges that mark the Ethiopian’s contentment
of mind at the prospect of warm weather
and of his limbs once more becoming “souple.” The
soft breeze begins to coat the tops of the damp furrows
with a thin, powdery crust that in a few days’ time
will be converted into that March dust so universally
beloved of farmers. The young wheat, smitten and
scorched and beaten almost out of recognition, lifts its
head once again and spreads a carpet of tender green
to the sun. The early lambs, beginning to think that
after all they were not sent into the world to shiver behind
strawstacks, frisk and gambol in the fields. The
blacksmiths’ shops at the cross roads and the courthouse
villages are thronged with colored laborers and
tenants, whose masters, now seeding-time is upon them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
have suddenly remembered that every plow in the
place is out of fix, and not a harrow has its full complement
of teeth. The light breezes from the southwest
moans softly in the pines; but among the deciduous
trees not a withered shred of foliage is left for it
to stir, and the silence is complete. The freshly awakened
sunlight streams softly down between the leafless
branches and the rugged trunks of oak and chestnut,
hickory and poplar, and plays upon the golden carpet
of wasted leaves that hides the earth beneath them.</p>

<p>The doctor, as he stands at the edge of the forest,
would ordinarily upon such a day be deep in agricultural
reveries of a most sanguine nature. But he is
now waiting for one more note of evidence that there
is a prospect of what he would call “a chase”&mdash;hesitating
as to the widow Gubbins.</p>

<p>Suddenly there is a great commotion in the wooded
valley beneath, and in a few seconds you might be in
Leicestershire spinny, so busy and joyful are the little
pack with their tongues. “That’s a fox, any way,”
says the doctor to the sorrel mare, “and, likely as not,
a red.” Two small farmers, jogging down the road,
pull up their horses and yell with the peculiar shrill
scream that is traditionally as much a part of Virginia
fox-hunting as the familiar cries of the British hunting-field
are with us. The doctor, though his voice is
not what it was thirty years ago, catches the infection,
and standing up in his wooden, leather-capped stirrups,
halloos at his hounds in what he would call
“real old Virginia fashion.”</p>

<p>“By G&mdash;d! it’s a red,” says one of the small farmers,
who had perched himself on the top of the fence,
so as to look down over the sloping tree-tops on to the
opposite hill.</p>

<p>“The dogs are out of the wood, and are streakin’ it
up the broom-sedge field yonder&mdash;dawg my skin if
they ain’t!”</p>

<p>This is too much for the doctor.</p>

<p>“Pull down the fence, gentlemen, for God’s sake!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
and we’ll push on up to the old Matthews graveyard
on top of the hill. We shall see right smart of the
chase from there. I know that old fox; he’ll go
straight to the pines on Squire Harrison’s quarter
place.”</p>

<p>The four or five top rails are tossed off the snake
fence; but the doctor can’t wait for the remaining
six. The long spur is applied to the flank of the sorrel
mare, the apple switch to her shoulder. Amid a crashing
and scattering of rotten chestnut-rails, the doctor,
cloak, and spectacles, saddle-bags, pills, medicine-bottles,
and overalls, lands safely in the corn-stalk field
upon the other side. The two farmers follow through
the fearful breach he has made, and they may soon
all be heard upon the opposite hill cheering and yelling
to the hounds, which by this time are well out of
reach of such encouraging sounds. Neither the country,
nor the horse, nor the doctor is adapted for riding
to hounds; nor, as I have before intimated, has
the latter any idea of doing so. The good man wants
to hear as much as possible&mdash;of the chase; but when
he neither sees nor hears a great deal&mdash;which, when
a strong red fox goes straight away, is generally the
case&mdash;he will still take much delight in collecting the
details from other sources.</p>

<p>If his hounds eventually kill their fox half-way
across the county, friends and neighbors, who became
accidental witnesses of various stages of the chase,
and each of whom did their share of hallooing and
cheering, will send round word to the “old doctor,”
or “call by” the next time they pass his house, and
cheer his heart with praises of his dogs. The doctor
will probably have bandaged Mrs. Gubbins’s leg, and
be half-way home by the time the death-scene takes
place, in some laurel thicket possibly miles and miles
away from the corner where we left our friend bursting
through the fence. Not more than half a dozen,
probably, of the fourteen or fifteen hounds with
which the doctor started, will assist at the finish. Two
or three of the puppies will have dropped out early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
in the day, and come home hunting rabbits all the
way. Three or four more are perhaps just over distemper,
and will fall in their tracks, to come limping
and crawling home at noon. Rambler and Fairfax,
however, having assisted at the finish, and being perhaps
the most knowing old dogs of the lot, will have
trotted round to old Colonel Peyton’s close by. They
are mighty hungry&mdash;for Virginia hounds won’t touch
foxes’ flesh&mdash;and they succeed in slipping into the
log kitchen in the yard, while Melindy, the cook, is
outside collecting chips, and abstracting from the top
of the stove an entire ham. The said ham was just
prepared for the colonel’s supper; but in fox-hunting
all is forgiven. So after a little burst of wrath he
reckons they are the old doctor’s clogs, shuts them up
in the granary, and gives them a cake of corn-bread
apiece. The following day is Saturday, and the colonel’s
son, home from school for a holiday, thinks
it an opportunity for a rabbit-hunt in the pines behind
the house not to be missed. So Rambler and
Fairfax are introduced to the proposed scene of action
in the morning. After condescending to an hour
of this amusement, they hold a canine consultation,
and start for home, where they finally arrive about
sundown, to be made much of by the doctor, who has
already heard of the finish from a negro who was
splitting rails close by.</p>

<p>The doctor’s satisfaction is quite as great as if he
had cut down a whole Leicestershire field in the fastest
thing of the season. His heart warms towards those
undersized, harsh-coated, slab-sided little friends of
his as he stands watching the negro woman breaking
up their supper of hot corn-bread with buttermilk
as a treat, on the back porch. They have all come in
by this time, and scuffle and growl and snap around
the board as the food is thrown to them.</p>

<p>The knowing ones take advantage of such an evening
as this to assert, with more than usual assurance,
their right of entry to the house. The doctor has had
his supper, and hopes that no ominous shout from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
the darkness will, for this night at any rate, call him
to some distant sick-bed. He has drawn up his one-armed
rocking-chair to the parlor fire, and by the
kerosene lamp is poring over the last oration on free
trade by that grand old Virginia gentleman and senator,
Mr. Jefferson Randolph Beverly Page. Conscious,
as it were, that some extra indulgence is deserved
on this night, the dogs begin to crawl in. One
by one, beginning with the oldest and wiliest and
ending with the timidest puppy, they steal into the
room and become grouped in the order of their audacity
from the glowing bricks of the hearth outward
to the door.</p>

<p>Nor to-night has the doctor kicks or cuffs or anathemas
for the very worst of them.</p>

<p>The great oak logs blaze and crackle and roar in the
wide chimney, and the light of the flames flickers over
the quaint, low-ceilinged room with its whitewashed
walls, black wainscotting, and homely decorations;
over the antlers on the door, that recall some early
exploit of the doctor’s in West Virginia wilds; over
the odds and ends of old silver on the sideboard, that
have been saved from the wreck of the Patton grandeur;
over the big oil-painting of the famous jurist,
and the dimmer, smokier visages of less distinguished
but remoter ancestors, who believed in the divine right
of kings and knew nothing of republics and universal
suffrage. Here, however, surrounded by his dogs,
we must take leave of the doctor. There are few like
him left now in Virginia, and fewer still who have
clung to the good and bad of a departed era with the
same uncompromising tenacity as our old friend.
They were a fine race&mdash;deny it who will&mdash;these old
Virginia squires; provincial and prejudiced perhaps,
but full of originality and manly independence.
Their ideas, it is true, are not those of the latter half
of the nineteenth century, but the men themselves
are passing rapidly away, and their ideas with them.
Those who have known them can only regret that a
strong, picturesque, and admirable type of Anglo-Saxon
has disappeared forever from the ranks of our
great family, unpainted by a single master-hand of
contemporary date.</p>

<h2 class="p2">THE DOCTOR’S FRONT YARD.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dci.jpg" width="100" height="118" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi080">IT ALL began with the tap of a gavel&mdash;an
imposing white gavel adorned with a yellow
bow and resounding like the crack of doom.
Behind it, under a nodding purple ostrich feather,
sat Mrs. Bunker; before it the eight awe-struck members
of the Village Improvement Society; enveloping
us all in its cold, judicial atmosphere was room No. 10
of the new town building, maintained as a meeting
place in order to give dignity to our association, and
its rent representing just so many entertainments and
strawberry-festivals per annum.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bunker is the “progressive woman” of West
Hedgeworth. She lives in that large, white house with
the terraces and box borders and a fountain, just
where you turn into Main street. She goes to Boston
twice each season to get clothes and ideas upon which
she feeds our little social circle through the medium
of clubs and afternoon teas. The clothes are remarkable,
the ideas equally up to date; we look upon her
with reverence and obey her slightest mandate.</p>

<p>I believe I am the only one who now and then rebels
inwardly. Why, for example, I should have been
considered eligible for the V. I. S., a girl of twenty-three,
with not the slightest pretensions to domestic
talent or judgment, except that I have had to take
care of father and the boys for the last few years, I
couldn’t see,&mdash;nor could any one else; but Mrs. Bunker
had ordained that I should go into it, and I had
no choice.</p>

<p>“You are a very clever girl, Irene,” she explained
severely, as if this were a situation to be deprecated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
but could be atoned for by penance of some sort, “and
it would be extremely unfortunate for you to have no
outlet for your talents. People should take up the
work that best suits them.”</p>

<p>I withdrew all objections, of course. If Mrs. Bunker
pronounces one clever, no matter how wretched
one may be under the verdict, there is never any appeal
from it. But as the progressive woman is always
ready to shoulder the responsibility of her friends’
cleverness, I haven’t found mine a very great burden.
So far as the duties of membership in the Village Improvement
Society are concerned, they only consist
in doing as one is bid. The gavel roused me from a
study of bonnets. Mrs. Suter, the wife of our good
druggist, and Mrs. Pitman, the postmaster’s lady, always
faithfully advertise the village milliner in
familiar black-lace-covered frames, the one adorned
with aggressive bunches of buttercups, the other
trailed over by a hairy-leaved poppy. Mrs. Cope, the
Episcopal clergyman’s wife, has the parish down upon
her for appearing in unmistakable French headgear,
simple, but beyond imitation; it does not justify her
in their eyes that the hats come from a rich relative,
and the poor soul is credited with proud and haughty
aspirations, of which she is as innocent as a babe. Miss
Maria Withers’ strong point is not fashion; so the
little parched, limp, black bonnet which she has found
satisfactory for eight years, still perches above her
gray curls. I was absorbed in working out a series of
arguments on the effect of dress upon character, when
the white gavel descended and the Society came to
order with a start.</p>

<p>We are nothing if not parliamentary. The latest
manual lies at Mrs. Bunker’s right hand. Miss Scrapson,
of the academy, makes an excellent secretary, and
her minutes are comprehensive. Miss Withers, as
treasurer, is somewhat rambling and uncertain. Her
reports are subject to pauses, silent mental calculations
and ejaculations of “Dear me,&mdash;no, that wasn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
it&mdash;just wait a minute,” and excursions into a little
black bag which she carries, after missing items on
stray scraps of paper. Mrs. Bunker bears this with self-control,
as Miss Maria has valuable qualities. Miss
Scrapson and Mrs. Cope play into her hands most
cleverly in a discussion over a motion or a point of
order. We manage to have a little unfinished business
on the carpet, usually, to give style to the meeting,
and altogether maintain an air of importance which is
quite remarkable for a small village club. But on this
particular day, a May morning, I saw in our president’s
eye that there was something new and exciting
to be taken up.</p>

<p>“Ladies,” she announced at last, “our spring campaign
is opening with opportunities of no mean order.
The village of West Hedgeworth is menaced with a
disgrace which so far outdoes in horror even the peanut
shells on the post-office floor and the loose papers
on the common that words almost fail me as I mention
it. Give me your close attention, please.”</p>

<p>Ever since the meeting when Mrs. Bunker took Mrs.
Pitman to task for the condition of her ash barrels,
we have been subject to a weak-kneed and guilty sensation
when she gives us an introduction of this sort.</p>

<p>“You probably know,” she continued in more colloquial
style, “the small house with pointed gables and
a piazza, fronting the common next the old Benjamin
place. You are aware how neatly it has always been
kept by former occupants. That house is just rented
by a doctor who has come here with his wife, I am
told, from New York. They moved in a week ago, and
in that short space of time,&mdash;<i>one week</i>, ladies,&mdash;they
have made the premises a blot upon the scutcheon of
our lovely village. Their packing-cases were unloaded
on the piazza in a high wind, and bits of paper, excelsior
and what not are scattered from end to end of
the yard; boxes, planks, tin cans and other refuse are
piled at one side; the whole appearance of the establishment
is enough to make one <i>of us</i>,”&mdash;impressively&mdash;”avert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
her head in passing it. And still the scandal
goes on, unabated, from day to day. It is a moment
for immediate action, a moment to be seized by
patriotic and public-spirited women, and the disturbers
of our peace of mind made to feel the necessity of
taking immediate steps towards reform. I lay the case
before you, ladies, for suggestions as to prompt aggression.”</p>

<p>There was a suitable pause. Then Miss Withers’
gentle voice piped up. “This is really a dreadful
state of things,” she began mildly. “I hadn’t noticed
it myself, I suppose because”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Hadn’t noticed it!” ejaculated the president, in
tones of thunder.</p>

<p>“I was going to say,” fluttered Miss Maria hurriedly,
“because I haven’t passed there in two weeks. If
I had, no doubt I should have been very much annoyed
about it.”</p>

<p>“<i>Annoyed!</i>” exclaimed Mrs. Bunker again, savagely.
“Annoyance is altogether too personal a term.
It arouses all <i>my</i> loyalty to the society; that’s the way
it impresses <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>Of course this brought forth many protestations of
the same sentiment from the rest of us. Then Mrs.
Pitman ventured to ask if Mrs. Bunker didn’t think it
would be well to send a committee to the doctor and
ask him to “clear up a little.”</p>

<p>“The chair has no thoughts, Mrs. Pitman,” answered
that body loftily. “I await a motion.”</p>

<p>I always second everybody else’s motion, but have
never made one yet, in the meetings. Miss Scrapson,
however, came to the fore, and it was presently decided
that the president should appoint a committee
to visit the doctor and his lady and reprove them.</p>

<p>“If that is really the pleasure of the Association,”
said Mrs. Bunker, with a wave of her purple ostrich
plume, “I will appoint Miss Allison” (that is my
name), “a committee of one to call at the doctor’s
house for this purpose. As you are one of the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
ladies of the place, Irene, it would be in the way of
your social duty at any rate. You can mingle business
with pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Yes,&mdash;but Mrs. Bunker, I never <i>could</i> mingle
things! Don’t ask me to go,” I implored. “I’m sure
I shall make a failure of it. I don’t want to offend
them, you know,&mdash;they may be nice people.”</p>

<p>“<i>Nice people!</i>” Mrs. Bunker compressed her lips
into that peculiar stiff smile which means scorn, and
closed her eyes slowly with her head tilted back.</p>

<p>“They certainly must be lax,” murmured Miss
Scrapson,&mdash;”very lax.” Nobody, however, came to
my rescue. I was evidently doomed to be the unhappy
instrument of the Society’s revenge. I gave in and
took my instructions as meekly as I could.</p>

<p>“The wife has an extremely youthful and inexperienced
air,” said my mentor, “and undoubtedly needs
a little judicious instruction. It will alarm her less
to be confronted by a person of her own age. Our
work is largely educational, you know, so do not antagonize
her. Simply say to her something of this
kind in gentle but firm tones: ‘My dear madam, do
you not appreciate the beauty of this peaceful little
village, and will you not bear your part henceforward
in the maintenance of its order and symmetry?’ Such
a method of speech would be better than to alarm her.
And yet don’t fail to impress upon her that disorder
simply <i>cannot be</i>.”</p>

<p>I acquiesced, with a slightly strangling sound, which
the president did not notice, fortunately. It resulted
from physical distress of a kind which is sometimes on
these occasions, beyond control. It was with me yet,
in a milder form, as I ascended the doctor’s steps that
afternoon, card-case in hand, which last appendage
seemed the most despicable mockery.</p>

<p>The house was a neat, smart little affair in its way,
inartistic, but not aggressively ugly, and well arranged
for professional purposes. The sign, <i>Dr. M. H. Richmond</i>,
was tacked up beside the door. There certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
were evidences of an upheaval, however, in plain sight.
The front yard was, as Mrs. Bunker had described it,
littered with papers and excelsior, the piazza floor as
bad. At the side of the house was a pile of tin cans,
boxes, broken china and other unsightly abominations.
Somehow one could not help feeling that a woman’s
eye and touch were wanting, and I found myself stiffening
against the wife who could allow such a state of
affairs to go on. My primmest expression was ready,
as the door flew open, swung hospitably wide by a big
young man with a short brown beard and gray eyes.
The moment I saw him it occurred to me to wonder
what he would take me for&mdash;patient, caller, or perhaps
an agent! Horrible thought, that last,&mdash;I found a certain
timidity threatening my assurance.</p>

<p>“Might I,” I began, putting myself into the latter
category at once by my mode of address, “might I
see the lady of the house, please?”</p>

<p>“Walk in, won’t you?” said the doctor affably, ushering
me into what happened to be his office. Ah,&mdash;one
knew now a little better where one was. Whatever
its exterior shortcomings, this must be the home
of thoroughly cultivated people. Their furniture was
solid, their pictures were fine, and their few decorations
faultless.</p>

<p>As to their books, filling all available space, no library
critic could find the selection wanting in true
literary discrimination. I felt the courage of my mission
diminishing as I slid into a leather covered arm
chair opposite the easy, amused looking doctor.</p>

<p>“I’m so very sorry,” he observed, “that she isn’t at
home. She went away by the early train this morning;
but perhaps you could leave a message with me
if it’s a matter of importance.”</p>

<p>There was a short but awkward pause. No help for
it,&mdash;I might as well make the plunge. The more Bunkerish
I could be, the better, if any stern message
was to be sent to the wife by this good-natured personage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wanted to see Mrs. Richmond,” I explained
stiffly, “on a little matter of business connected with
the work of the Village Improvement Society. It was
reported at our last meeting that the condition of your
front yard is very bad.”</p>

<p>“My front yard! I see.” The doctor looked quizzical
but serene, and glanced out over his shoulder to
the lawn.</p>

<p>“Our Association,” I continued bravely, “aims to
incite the pride of householders in the appearance of
the village as well as in their own homes; and your
place here is conspicuous, facing the common as it
does. We thought that might not have occurred to
you.”</p>

<p>“It really hadn’t,” smiled my host. “This is very
kind of you, however. Do I understand that your
Society orders me, through you, to clear up the yard?
In that case, do they provide cleaners and so forth,&mdash;or
will they perhaps come and take charge of it themselves?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” I exclaimed angrily. “You are expected
to attend to it.”</p>

<p>“What should you do,” he inquired suavely, “if I
left it in disorder? I ask from curiosity, naturally,
as I should never have the temerity to defy so august
a body. Would the law be obliged to take its course?”</p>

<p>“You are probably aware that we have no law whatever
behind us,” I said with all the dignity I could assume,
“though the selectmen are very good about
backing us up in flagrant cases. But I should imagine
a doctor just settling in a town would be sufficiently
alive to his own interests to see the propriety of making
a good impression by the appearance of his house
and grounds.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” He nodded slowly, smiling in a way which
maddened me. “Now I see. This is a special kindness
on your part. How grateful I am to you. Your suggestion
may really result in my winning the hearts
of the West Hedgeworth people; and I shall begin at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
once. The propriety of making a good impression by
the appearance of my house and grounds!&mdash;it is a
noble sentiment. My colored boy who is my only servant,
shall attend to the matter, and the Village Improvement
Society shall see a change indeed. Are
there any other little touches,&mdash;extra touches, you
know,&mdash;that occur to you?”</p>

<p>I glanced at the big, low table with its littering of
attractive books and magazines, a great ivory club of
a paper knife lying across an uncut review. I was
as much at home among those things as he. Why had
I been forced into the attitude of an impertinent village
miss, to be laughed over with his wife again in
the way he was laughing now? The idea was distressing;
but I had no defence.</p>

<p>“I think you are quite capable of arranging your
own yard,” I said curtly. “You will very soon find
out what the village people like. All that our Association
requires is cleanliness and good order;”&mdash;with
which I moved towards the door, murmuring a regret
that I had not seen Mrs. Richmond.</p>

<p>“This is so good of you”&mdash;and now the doctor actually
showed a shade of embarrassment himself,&mdash;”that
I am really overwhelmed with shame to be
obliged to disappoint you about my wife. It would
be so pleasant for her to know you ladies and to”&mdash;he
coughed slightly&mdash;”to come under your helpful influence.
But the fact is, she isn’t&mdash;she doesn’t&mdash;there
never has&mdash;in short, there isn’t any Mrs. Richmond.
My sister came with me to help me settle things. She
is a college girl somewhat younger than I and with
no experience whatever. I hope you will be willing to
welcome her when she comes back in July,&mdash;that is,
of course, if we are tidy enough to be recognized by
the villagers.” Still the blandest expression about
his mouth, but a twinkle in the gray eyes which made
me grind my teeth. And he had calmly sat there,
letting me call on <i>him</i>!</p>

<p>I attempted to “sweep” across the piazza with dignity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
but only swept up little bits of excelsior on the
hem of my gown. But I did make him feel the arrows
of a dignified wrath, I think;&mdash;not that he
evinced any such sensation at the time. To Mrs. Bunker,
who had asked for a prompt report, I flew. She
took the affair with unsympathetic calmness.</p>

<p>“You did your duty, Irene,” was her gracious commendation,
“and it was not your fault that the girl&mdash;who
certainly was there, for I <i>saw</i> her&mdash;should be
his sister and not his wife. You said precisely the
right thing, and I trust he will profit by it and earn
the respect of the village. I am glad he is a young
man of taste.”</p>

<p>He got on, whether possessed of taste or not. It
annoyed me to see the way he made friends with
everybody who crossed his path, man, woman or child.
They were rather slow to consult him professionally;
but Doctor Bell, the old physician who had all the
practice round here, lives at Hedgeworth Centre, three
miles away, so when Miss Ph&oelig;be Withers, Miss
Maria’s older sister, had an attack of heart failure one
day, they sent for Doctor Richmond, and took a tremendous
fancy to him. I kept out of his way; to my
mind he was the most thoroughly disagreeable man I
ever met.</p>

<p>The front yard, meanwhile, had been cleared up.
Nick, the black imp who drove, cooked and gardened
for the doctor, was known to be mysteriously occupied
behind the house for hours at a time, after the rubbish
was removed. Mrs. Benjamin saw it all from
her back windows, and reported it at the sewing society.
He spent hours pottering among paint-cans,
starting seeds and what not; and shortly after, the
front fence appeared painted grass green, the gate
picked out with white cross-bars, and the lamp-post
similarly decorated, bearing a brand-new reflector.
Then clam-shell borders to the gravel-walk cropped
out, and two round clam-edged beds of geraniums
stared from the lawn, while a “rockery” of red and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
blue boulders, with ferns, reared itself where the piles
of tin cans had been.</p>

<p>“Do you like <i>that</i> sort of thing, I want to know?” I
inquired wrathfully of Mrs. Bunker at our next Village
Improvement meeting.</p>

<p>“Well, it looks perfectly neat,” she answered, “and
it is in the style of most of the best kept yards here.
I can’t say that <i>I</i> should not prefer quieter colors;
but he is a young man yet, you know.”</p>

<p>I was silenced. What right had I, any way, to feel
as if there were a sort of practical joke on me, personally,
in all this? The day after, a new ornament
appeared;&mdash;a pair of andirons, painted scarlet, and
a hollowed out log across them filled with yellow nasturtiums.
Mrs. Pitman pointed it out to me delightedly.</p>

<p>“Just like a real fire!” she said. “Do you see,
Irene? The doctor is quite a landscape gardener,
isn’t he?” I made no reply.</p>

<p>Another decoration was set forth next, on the opposite
side of the yard;&mdash;this time a crane, also of
scarlet hue, and a swinging pot, with money-wort bubbling
in it and dribbling down the sides. By ill luck
I was passing at the moment when Nick put it there,
turning round with a grin for the approval of his master,
who stood in the window.</p>

<p>“Very good, indeed, Nick,” I heard the doctor call
out. “You’re a regular Village Improvement Society
in yourself, boy.” I wondered if it were possible, by
Delsartian methods, to throw scorn into the expression
of one’s back. The attempt ended weakly in one
of those little conscious adjustments of drapery to
which one resorts involuntarily at such junctures.
Somehow I felt that those gray eyes were upon me. I
had occasionally caught the expression of them before,
always with the inevitable twinkle, when we met in
public.</p>

<p>He grew into the habit of dropping in at the Bunkers’,
to my disgust, as it spoiled my own intimacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
there. Mr. B., a shadowy figure in the background of
the family stage, had been cured, or imagined he had,
of rheumatism by the new physician, and took a great
fancy to him. Emily, the daughter, who is so fearfully
quiet that most people never make any attempt to
rouse her, was actually known to chat with him quite
naturally and easily; and our beloved president submitted
to cruel thrusts from him with a good grace.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bunker,” he said one evening as we were all
sitting on the piazza in a June twilight, “you’ve
never told me yet how you liked the arrangement of
my front yard. Have you seen the new garden seat I
had put out this week? It’s one of the latest fads in
outdoor decoration, made of the head-board and frame
of an antique bedstead&mdash;a very choice thing. I got
the idea from a farmhouse up on the north road.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t noticed it,” she answered somewhat cautiously,
“but I observe, doctor, that you have an idea
of falling in with the taste of the people.”</p>

<p>“My dear madam,” he clasped his hand round one
knee and looked off dreamily into space,&mdash;”a doctor
just settling down in a town should be sufficiently
alive to his own interests to see the propriety of making
a good impression by the appearance of his house
and grounds.”</p>

<p>How dared he mock me to my very face in this fashion?
I was thankful for the little back gate leading
out of the Bunkers’ grounds, by which I could get a
short cut home, leaving my good-byes with Emily
Bunker. When we met accidentally at the post-office
next morning, I turned my back on him to stamp some
letters, and never looked up till he was gone, after
telling Alice Cobb, one of the village belles, who stood
there, that he was going away in the afternoon to his
sister’s Commencement and would bring her back
with him.</p>

<p>The week seemed very peaceful, and I enjoyed going
about without the dread of further shafts of ridicule.
I was always planning some way to give his impertinence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
a decided snub, but never found the
chance. The afternoon of his return, I was sitting
with my work in Mrs. Benjamin’s parlor as the buggy
drove up, Nick having been left to walk home from
the station. When he helped the sister out,&mdash;a manifestly
high bred, charming little blonde,&mdash;I couldn’t
help watching for the effect upon her of those painted
monstrosities. She wouldn’t tolerate them a moment,
I felt sure. But oh, stab after stab! She gave one
glance at them and turned to her brother with an
expression of such utter merriment that I knew at
once the thing was a joke already understood between
the two. I decided that Amy Richmond would <i>not</i>
become a friend of mine. Yet curiously enough she
actually sought me out, at an academy reception the
next night. Emily Bunker introduced her, and she
began at once: “I’ve been so anxious to meet you, Miss
Allison. Morris tells me so much about you, and he’s
sure we shall be congenial.”</p>

<p>I stiffened. Another back-handed thrust, probably,
lay underneath this.</p>

<p>“He thinks I shall learn an immense amount from
you, too,” she pursued,&mdash;”don’t you Morris?”&mdash;to
the doctor, who was unexpectedly standing behind me.</p>

<p>“I’ve told my sister,” he answered, “that she must
persuade you to give her some hints about household
matters. She hasn’t had even as much experience yet
as Nick and I.”</p>

<p>I tried to be very ungracious, as dark suspicions
flew through my mind; but Miss Richmond looked absolutely
guileless, and furthermore she wouldn’t let
me alone; there was no use trying to avoid her. And
it <i>did</i> seem good to have a friend of her sort. The
West Hedgeworth girls are bright and pretty, and
some of them intellectual, but we had all been village
comrades too long to get up much enthusiasm over one
another’s society. Doctor Richmond’s brotherly devotion
caused him to lend his sister the buggy and
spirited little horse for her own use now and then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
besides the drives she took with him; so we two enjoyed
long excursions through the country roads,
steeped in July sunshine and finding our mutual interest
deeper with every day. Once I went to tea with
them, and on that occasion the doctor seemed quite
like other people, except just as I was leaving under
the escort of my younger brother, which I had purposely
arranged, the temptation to give me a parting
thrust was too strong for him, and he remarked as we
descended the front steps: “Miss Allison, I am so
glad to have had you get a glimpse of our clam-shells
in the moonlight.”</p>

<p>Amy went off to the seashore a day or two later, and
I felt really sorry for him, but it was much the easiest
way to avoid him altogether, and I never asked him
to come to our house, nor crossed his path if I could
help it. As for the nasturtiums and geraniums,
scorching on his lawn in the midsummer heat, I wanted
no sight of them. By and by I went away myself,
and came back in September to a taste of the unpleasantnesses
of life. My two brothers left home, one to a
business position in Boston, the other to college.
Father, meanwhile, who for eight years since mother’s
death had been lost in melancholy and required my
constant offices as consoler, divulged the fact that a
buxom widow in Hedgeworth Centre had succeeded in
resurrecting his buried affections; an individual as
utterly unlike&mdash;well, there was a sting about it all
that made things look pretty black for awhile, and
since they desired the engagement “kept quiet,” I
locked up my woes and could only wonder now and
then whether anybody felt any sympathy, while parrying
the usual village questions about father’s frequent
drives to the Centre. The Bunkers went abroad
for the winter, thank Heaven!&mdash;and the V. I. S. was
suspended for the time being. Mercifully I had a
chance to do something for somebody else. Aunt
Abby, my mother’s sister, who had lived alone with
her servants in a big house fronting the common, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
rather morose and unmanageable old maiden lady,
was breaking down. My other aunt, who lives in California,
could not come east at once, so I was the only
member of the family to nurse her, and with father
and the boys provided for I had time to go to her
whenever she needed me.</p>

<p>Dr. Bell fell ill and Dr. Richmond was called. His
appearance in the sick-room seemed likely to destroy
the only comfort I had there; but, strange to say, I
laid down my weapons before three visits were over.
His management of her was absolutely perfect;
thoughtful, gentle, cheery, and so patient with her
whims and imaginings, poor old soul, that his coming
grew to be the one bright spot in her life, and I fancied
she would give herself up to complete invalidism
for the sake of them. But he looked grave one day
over her, and informed me she must have a nurse.</p>

<p>“Do you think me incapable?” I asked rather
sharply.</p>

<p>“No, but you couldn’t hold out to do all there is to
be done. Your aunt is going to be worse, Miss Allison,
and I doubt if we can pull her through. You’ll want
somebody for night work.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith, the village nurse, is the dreariest of her
kind, and brings an atmosphere of melancholy with
her. My services were needed as cheerer-up from this
time on, for poor Aunt Abby grew visibly weaker, and
finally one stormy night the end seemed near, so I did
not go home. Dr. Richmond came in about nine o’clock
and found me in the cold, lofty parlor with its straight
backed furniture and grim family portraits.</p>

<p>“See here,” he remarked as he returned from the
sick-room, “mightn’t you be a little more comfortable
somehow? You can’t sit up all night on the edge of a
slippery sofa like that. Why don’t you doze, and let
the nurse call if she wants you?”</p>

<p>I had unconsciously taken the attitude of my childhood’s
years, when sent to call on Aunt Abby and
charged not to let my feet touch the furniture, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
hands crossed in my lap, and spine rigid. But I
couldn’t have slept at any rate, I told him, and should
manage all right.</p>

<p>He opened the front door to depart, then came back.
A West Indian tornado was tearing at the house and
lashing the trees with howls of fury, the chimneys
moaning and blinds rattling. He looked at me irresolutely,
I sitting motionless. What did a mere storm
matter,&mdash;a tumult of nature which would be over by
morning? <i>He</i> might object to it, with nothing worse
to worry about; it made no difference to me.</p>

<p>“I must be on hand every hour, anyway,” he said
slowly, “to watch your aunt’s pulse. Neither you nor
the nurse would understand it. If you don’t mind,
I’ll stay here, instead of coming back and forth across
the common in such a gale as this. And meanwhile let
me show you a better way to rest.”</p>

<p>Poor Aunt Abby! It was fortunate that she could
not see her plush sofa moved around cornerwise and
its end filled with pillows, nor the logs which the doctor
brought from the cellar piled across her beautifully
polished, unused andirons. Had I any business
to sink back luxuriously and enjoy the sparkle and
warmth of a fire, with that unconscious figure in the
next room? I sprang up again and tiptoed in to ask
the nurse if I might not take her place.</p>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Smith dolorously but firmly, “you
ain’t experienced enough to watch out her last hours.
Miss Abby’s been good to me in ways I sha’n’t say
nothin’ about, and I’m a-goin’ to see her through. All
I want you for is to call if I need you, and so long as
I ain’t all alone I shall stay up till the last.”</p>

<p>I crept back, feeling incompetent and useless, and
with some of the diminished nerve which results from
the nearness and certainty of death&mdash;that hour we are
never ready for.</p>

<p>“Lie against the cushions, please,” commanded the
doctor quietly. “Now I’m going to be here and watch
every symptom. You won’t have to keep anything on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
your mind,&mdash;and your aunt may rally, remember,
perhaps even return to consciousness again. Just put
the responsibility entirely on Mrs. Smith and me, and
try to rest as much as you can.”</p>

<p>There was no resisting this; he should not see, however,
that my eyes grew moist under the unwonted
sensation of being looked out for. I turned my head
away to pull my forces together, but he had gone back
to Aunt Abby’s bedside. When he came out, in about
five minutes, he told me that all was going well, and
then sitting down began to speak of everyday matters.
Before very long a better footing was established between
us than ever before, and for a couple of hours
we talked, only interrupted by visits to the sick-room.
I forgot my secret smart at having been ridiculed, in
hearing Morris Richmond tell delightful bits of his
own experiences and life interest. Not being enough
of a woman of the world to resist the delicate flattery
which such a recital implies, I didn’t suspect him
either of adroitness enough to use his autobiography
for that purpose. But about twelve o’clock he looked
at his watch, then at me, and frowned.</p>

<p>“You’re horribly tired,” he said, “and I’ve no business
to keep you up when it isn’t necessary. Please
go upstairs to bed, and sleep till four o’clock. I shall
be here till then, and there will be absolutely nothing
for you to do. If your aunt is improving, you needn’t
be called till seven, for you can take Mrs. Smith’s
place to-morrow, and Mrs. Benjamin will come over to
help you if you need her.”</p>

<p>Evidently he himself was tired of talking so long.
I didn’t give him credit for any especially disinterested
motives in sending me off, but went with some
resentment, since he so plainly wished me to go. I
didn’t sleep, however. The mirror on the wall of the
barren guest room moved from some hidden draught
or jar, the old willow whipped its twigs against the
window panes, and I lay watching them with a strange
tumult in my heart, a whirlwind of whys and conjectures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
a creeping nervousness as to the outcome of the
next few hours, a lonely dread of the after months
when Aunt Abby should be gone and my home life
changed,&mdash;and yet, through it all, an odd new satisfaction
which I tried to push away, and a tendency to
go over word for word the talk of that evening and
the looks on Morris Richmond’s face. There was a
faint dawn in the room before I knew it, and then it
occurred to me that the doctor ought to have a little
breakfast after his long vigil. The servants were
asleep, but the kitchen fire had been left “in,” and I
knew where everything was kept. I freshened myself
up and stole down the back stairs to cook coffee and
eggs and hot toast. In the midst of it the door opened
behind me, and I started guiltily.</p>

<p>“What are you doing <i>now</i>?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“How did you know?” I faltered.</p>

<p>“The smell of that coffee going all through the
house is enough to wake anybody. So this is the way
you obey orders! Miss West is better, and I am just
going. You might perfectly well have slept on.”</p>

<p>“But I couldn’t,” I insisted, “and you will stay
and drink the coffee now that I have cooked it.”</p>

<p>He consented if I would have some too, and we ate
our impromptu meal in the dark dining-room, warming
up over it and chatting most familiarly. It was
growing light when the doctor took his hat in the hall.</p>

<p>“Thank you for being so good to me,” he said. “I
appreciate it. Now please don’t overdo. I sha’n’t be
in again probably until noon, unless you send for
me;”&mdash;and he opened the door, where we both stood
looking out. We were just opposite his house. The
storm was abating, but the havoc it had made was visible
everywhere. A big elm had been uprooted on the
common, and lay prone, with hundreds of scattered
twigs about it. And the doctor’s front yard? Alas!
Mrs. Benjamin’s old buttonwood tree, which had been
dying all summer, was crashed over, burying in its
prostrate branches the crane, the andirons, the gay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
beds and all. Nature itself had swept away the last
barriers now, I reflected triumphantly, to what might
be a good satisfactory friendship. Better days were
coming. But&mdash;</p>

<p>“Whew!” said my companion lightly. “Look over
there. Dear me&mdash;I must hurry home and set Nick at
work. It will take us a whole week to get square with
the Village Improvement Society!”</p>

<p>Aunt Abby lived nearly a month longer. Her sister
came on from California and took charge in the
sick-room with an energy which left very little for
others to do. After the funeral she went away again.
The property had been left to her, the house to me,
with just enough income to live, economically, in it.
Father and his affianced bride were well satisfied with
this arrangement, and made preparations to be married
at Thanksgiving, at which time I was to move into
my new abode. I felt it to be following indeed in
Aunt Abby’s footsteps, and could see myself in imagination
going on year after year with my one servant,
growing older and grimmer, brooding over past days,
finally slipping out of life without a friend in the
world. It was rather a new thing for me to take this
morbid view, but one always finds a fresh idea interesting,
and I hugged it for a time with all the vehemence
of my nature. The doctor I had seen now and
then, and we had managed to remain pretty well on
our new basis of easy and even confidential acquaintanceship.
But I could not forget the old grudge; he
would not keep up that spirit of mockery which
cropped out so often unless he regarded me still as a
village nonenity. Yet why need I care?</p>

<p>One November afternoon I started out to walk off
the blues. It was gray and windy, but with occasional
gleams of sunshine,&mdash;a good day for a hilltop. I went
by the Bunkers’ shut up mansion, waved to Miss
Maria at her little corner sitting-room window, shook
my head to resist Mrs. Benjamin’s beckoning hand as
I passed her door, and glanced at the doctor’s yard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
It was in order again indeed. The mutilated crane
and andirons had been removed, and the beds emptied
and raked over; but a new horror had been perpetrated
in the shape of two brilliant globular lawn-reflectors
on pedestals, one blue-gray, the other yellow, which
gave a miniature distorted panorama of all passing
objects and showed me a waddling image of myself,
with flattened, wrathful countenance. It was the last
straw, and I walked fiercely away, resolved that if my
future dwelling must be opposite this man’s, its front
blinds should be lowered forever.</p>

<p>As that walk registered just about the lowest point
my mental and spiritual barometer has ever reached,
I can hardly forget it. I climbed over Hart’s hill, and
from its summit looked off westward over level fields,
bounded by a horizon of tossing gray clouds and slits
of pale, yellow light. The old graveyard lay to the
right, smooth bare maple boughs tossed above me. The
road ran straight ahead, and I stood undecided whether
to go on down or not. If it had been in a story, I
reflected bitterly, the man I hated yet longed to see
would appear then and there; in real life such things
never happen at the right juncture. I should simply
go back, give father his tea, and see him depart as
usual for the evening, then sit alone.</p>

<p>But, after all, this is a story, or I shouldn’t be telling
it. A buggy turned out of the farm-yard half way
down the hill, and came toward me. I knew the horse
and occupant, and turned my feet resolutely homeward,
with a confusion in my brain which I thought
was anger. A rapid trot sounded behind me, and then
the doctor’s “Whoa!” I did not look up till I heard
him say: “Miss Allison, would you please let me drive
you home?”</p>

<p>“I came out for a walk,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Yes, but you’ve had the walk. And besides that,
you are more by yourself nowadays than is good for
you.” What business was it of his?&mdash;”Then, best of
all, I have a letter from Amy to read you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t suppose it matters,” said I, climbing
wearily in beside him, “only please have the goodness
<i>not</i> to drive me past your house. The prospect of looking
at it morning, noon and night hereafter is bad
enough since this latest infliction.”</p>

<p>“Infliction! do you really think so?” he asked, with
the old merriment in his voice. “But I had to put
something there, you know, to brighten it up a little.
You certainly would have me sufficiently alive to my
own interests as a physician, wouldn’t you, to see the
propriety&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop!” I burst out, my cheeks one flame and the
hot tears of tired-out nerves and pent-up anger springing
to my eyes. “Be kind enough to understand that
for your interests as a physician I don’t care one
straw!”</p>

<p>The Doctor turned and laid his hand gently on mine,
looking down at me with a smile which levelled all my
fortifications.</p>

<p>“Of course you don’t,” he said. “But as a man&mdash;you
surely must have seen by this time how badly I
need a wife! Won’t you come home and take command
of my front yard?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: In a half hour, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard</span>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span>: Meanwhile, tell my sister that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
want to speak with her. (<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Richard</span>, <span class="smcap">L.</span>) Now I’ll

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span>: Yes, a friend; or, rather a physician&mdash;a
physician ... for Rose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span> (<i>aside</i>): The same old delusion (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mr.
Valdingam</span>.) But, brother, Rose is quite well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span>: Well! You say <i>well</i>!...
It’s none of your business, however. Do as I bid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Pray do not worry over such a

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span>: That is very nicely said, sir....
As I informed you by letter, the case which you
are about to treat is a very serious one&mdash;a very complicated
one. It may even baffle you.... But
before I add anything, permit me to see my sister for
an instant. She is preparing a little supper for us,
and, if you don’t object, we shall eat it here, <i>tête-à-tête</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: With the greatest pleasure, Mr.
Valdingam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span>: Then kindly make yourself at
home. The house is yours while you are in it. (<i>Exit</i>
<span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span>, <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>throwing himself into an easychair</i>):
A comfortable place, certainly. That fellow,
Valdingam, however, is an odd chap. Restless and excitable,
I take it; but very agreeable, otherwise. I
wonder what sort of a little creature the patient is, by
the way. A stupid thing, I suppose.... (<i>After
a moment of reflection</i>.) Strange!&mdash;I wonder if I am
losing my own mind. For three days I’ve been in a
state which is positively abnormal. I am haunted by a
face, and I can’t rid my memory of it. And what a
face! Who could forget it after having once looked upon
it? I am in love with it. I am still more in love
with its owner. That smile, like a glimpse of paradise!
That mouth, like a dissected strawberry! That blush,
like the stolen red of a rose! Oh, shall I ever see her
again?</p>

<p class="pc">(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span>, <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span>: You must be hungry, Dr. Van
Hyde, and I fear that I can offer you little to appease
a healthy appetite&mdash;a bowl of broth, a tender bit of
broiled chicken, and some of the finest Burgundy in
the world to wash it down. We homely folk of the
country stick to the ancient fashions, you know,&mdash;a
noonday lunch, and all that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: I like your ancient fashions, as you
call them, Mr. Valdingam. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Richard</span>, <i>who sets
a small table for two and serves supper</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span>: Then let us sit down without ceremony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Your Burgundy is indeed delicious,
Mr. Valdingam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span>: I flatter myself that it is. It dissolves
the cobwebs from one’s brains, so to speak. It
is the elixir of happiness; and alas! I am not a happy
man, Dr. Van Hyde.... (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Richard</span>.) Leave us
alone, Richard. (<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Richard</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Perhaps you exaggerate your misfortunes,
my dear sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span>: Far from it&mdash;far from it....
Imagine a father, a doting father, like myself, whose
only child is on the verge of insanity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: It is a pitiful case, truly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span>: It is pitiful, and it is strange;
strange because my daughter Rose is, to all outward
appearances, as sane as you or I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: But there are symptoms&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span>: Symptoms which my keen sight
discovered long ago. (<i>Mysteriously.</i>) My daughter
is morally irresponsible in her social relations with
men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: You astonish me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span>: Prepare yourself for still greater
astonishment. Accustomed though you are to dealings
with the insane, I venture to say that Rose will deceive
you at first as she has deceived others.... However,
you are now on your guard. If you will permit
me to do so, I will indicate to you the line of inquiry
which you may adopt in your preliminary examination
of my daughter.</p>

<p class="ph2">(<i>As this conversation progresses the door at</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>is
opened slightly, and</i> <span class="smcap">Susan</span> <i>is seen to be listening.
Later she closes the door softly and disappears.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: With pleasure, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span>: Here is the point, then. My
daughter appears to fall in love with every young man
that strikes her fancy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Really&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span>: She may even fall in love with
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Extraordinary!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span>: Your course, therefore, will be to
draw from her some decisive manifestation of this abnormal
amativeness. You will not be slow to discover
how deep-rooted the disease is.... By the way,
would you object to meeting my daughter this evening?
I shall not allow you to return to New York to-night,
you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: I am wholly at your service.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span> (<i>ringing for</i> <span class="smcap">Richard</span>): So much
the better. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Richard</span>, <i>who removes the dining
table</i>.) Now, if you will join me in a cigar and a stroll
in the garden, we can talk more at our ease on this
painful subject. (<i>They light their cigars and pass out
into the garden. Enter from</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>at the same time</i> <span class="smcap">Susan</span>,
<i>followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Rose</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>: Well, what do you think of that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> (<i>laughingly</i>): I am very sorry for poor Dr.
Van Hyde. Suppose I should be attacked with a tender
passion for him, after all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>: Don’t be ridiculous, Rose. Between you
and me, however, it seems to me that this mad-doctor
here, who is said to be so very clever, might be turned
to some good purpose. I begin to think that your father
needs looking after.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Oh, papa is harmless. At any rate, wait
awhile. At present, you must remember, I am Dr. Van
Hyde’s patient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>: Nonsense!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: I intend that he shall practise on me, certainly,
especially if, as you assert, he is young and
handsome. Or, let us say, I will experiment on him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>: You are out of your senses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Not a bit. Has not Dr. Van Hyde come all
the way up here to see <i>me</i>, to examine <i>me</i>? Shall I
disappoint this luminary of the medical profession?...
Never!... Now, Aunt Susan, you must
let me have my own way this time. No harm shall
come of it, I promise you. And who knows? Perhaps
I may be able to give Dr. Van Hyde points for
his next clinic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>: Well, do as you please. But I fear the
worst. More than one sane creature has been clapped
into a lunatic asylum by some fool of a doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Tell me something more about this Dr. Van
Hyde.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>: I’ve told you all I know ... young,
handsome, and, I doubt not, a gentleman; very pleasant
mannered, so far as I could see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> (<i>musingly</i>): Young, handsome, pleasant mannered.
Not the traditional doctor, evidently; just
such a doctor as I might naturally fall in love with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>: Rose, you amaze me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: But I am not going to fall in love with him....
(<i>After a pause, and mischievously.</i>) Indeed,
I have some one else in my thought at this moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>: What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Don’t blame me if I am a little human. Have
you never met a man, Aunt Susan, who pleased you as
no other man had ever pleased you before?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>: Perhaps I have; but it was mighty long
ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Call me foolish if you will; I, too, have met
such a man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>: You! Where?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: You won’t be cross if I confide in you?
Besides, it’s not likely that I shall meet my Romeo
again?&mdash;for he was a Romeo, Aunt Susan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>: There are no Romeos nowadays.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Oh, yes, there are&mdash;in trousers. Now, let
me tell you my experience with him. It was not a bit
romantic. Last Monday, as you remember, I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
shopping in New York. To-day is Friday. (<i>With
mock gravity.</i>) An eternity from then till now....
Well, as I was rushing through a quiet side
street, in haste to catch a car, suddenly I slipped and
fell. My parasol went in one direction, my fan in
another, my purse in still another, and three parcels
I was carrying in three others. To make matters
worse, I had sprained my ankle slightly, and was
ready to cry with pain and mortification. Imagine
the situation, Aunt Susan. There I sat in a heap on
the pavement, surrounded by my possessions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span> (<i>grimly</i>): I hope you didn’t sit there long?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: How unsympathetic you are!... No,
I did not sit there long. For a second I was paralyzed.
Afterward, as I prepared to rise with proper dignity,
I heard a man’s voice&mdash;a particularly agreeable man’s
voice&mdash;close at my side. It said: “Permit me to assist
you, madam.” Before I could reply, the owner of
the voice lifted me to my feet. Oh, he did his part
gallantly! I was, of course, too confused to thank him
at once. But he did not stop for thanks. He simply
picked up my purse, my parasol, and my parcels, and
after placing them in my hands, and inquiring very
gently whether I was hurt, lifted his hat courteously
and passed on. Only for a single&mdash;a single instant,
Aunt Susan, our eyes met.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>: What then, pray?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Nothing. I limped to the car. That’s all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>: And this stranger is your Romeo! Rose,
you are a goose. Put him out of your head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: How can I put him out when he persists in
staying in? There, now you have my story.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span> (<i>starting at the sound of footsteps</i>): Hush!
I think your father and the doctor are coming back.</p>

<p class="ph2">(<i>Susan busies herself with one of the lamps at</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>, <i>and

the utmost confidence. What a knowledge is yours!
How vast, how intricate a subject is this of insanity!
I marvel that you should have learned so much in so
few years. I’ll wager that you have not passed your
thirty-fifth birthday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: You have made a nearly correct
guess, Mr. Mr Valdingam. I am in my thirty-sixth year.
But I have enjoyed unusual experience.</p>

<p class="ph2">(<i>At the sound of</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde’s</span> <i>voice, Rose half-rises,

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> (<i>aside</i>): Good gracious! I have heard that

chair, and joins Susan. The backs of the two women

Aunt Susan!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span> (<i>starting</i>): What’s the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>: Who’s the same?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: The doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>aside</i>): How did she come to be
alone in the city last Monday? She must have escaped

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Professionally speaking&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: As a rule, you know, it takes two old friends
to make a <i>tête-à-tête</i>. Now, it must be admitted that
we are not old friends, are we?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. van Hyde</span>: I trust that we shall be very good
friends soon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Oh, my father has recommended you, and I
may accept you on that basis. Are you from New
York?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: And you are a physician?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: I practice a little.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: I suppose papa is to be one of your patients.
He has not been strong. How is he, doctor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>aside</i>): She is very insistent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Why don’t you answer me? Is there some
serious complication?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>hurriedly</i>): Nothing serious, I assure
you.... In fact, I have had no conversation
with Mr. Valdingam about his health.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Then what about?... Oh, I forgot.
You are very old friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Very old friends. (<i>Aside.</i>) There
is a strange gleam in her eyes. Poor thing! Poor
thing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: It is singular that he had never spoken of
you before to-night.... (<i>After a pause of reflection.</i>)
Do you know, I feel that you called to see <i>me</i>,
as well as papa. Am I right?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Partly right, Miss Valdingam....
And I am <i>very</i> glad to have met you at last. I have
heard so much about you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Still, you had never <i>seen</i> me until this evening?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>taken by surprise</i>): Oh, I had....
(<i>Aside.</i>) What a silly business I am making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
of this! She looks so perfectly sane and charming
that I am tempted to forget my mission. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Rose</span>.)
It seemed to me almost, I mean, that I had met you&mdash;I
don’t know where.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> (<i>aside</i>): This is delicious. I must punish
him. (<i>Advancing toward him with an air of anger.</i>)
Sir, I perceive that you wish to mislead me. Your
presence here has a professional object. Do not deny
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: I&mdash;I&mdash;do not deny it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> (<i>tragically</i>): Connected with myself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>aside</i>): Suspicious of a stranger!
Restless under medical observation! These are
symptoms!... I must try to divert her thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: I repeat, sir&mdash;connected with myself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Pray, Miss Valdingam, do not excite
yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Conceal nothing! I am wretched, annoyed,
persecuted. I am under a wicked surveillance. Do
you imagine that I’m blind? I understand their plot.
(<i>Pointing to door at</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) And you, too, are in the
plot. But I shall prove to you&mdash;at once, <i>at once</i>&mdash;that
I am as rational as they, as you. (<i>In a quieter tone.</i>)
Now, have you any questions to ask me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>somewhat confused</i>): Do not take
the matter so seriously, Miss Valdingam. Even a rational
person&mdash;not excepting myself&mdash;may have theories,
hallucinations, dreams&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> (<i>wildly</i>): Dreams! I have astonishing
dreams, doctor. They come to me when I am awake,
when I <i>seem</i> to be awake. Strange noises then rattle
in my brain, and I grow dizzy. In any other person,
these dreams might be <i>ideas</i>.... At other times,
the world of my fancy is crowded with men, myriads
of men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>aside</i>): Her father was not mistaken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Yes, young men; graceful men; men who
flatter and adore me!... Totally unlike the men
I see when I escape to New York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Ah, she escapes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Then, too, I have visions of matrimony. I
feel a wild desire to propose to every man I meet.
Have you ever proposed, doctor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Never.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Why don’t you? You can not have lacked
opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: I fear that I have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: You are young, rich, good-looking, and successful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>aside</i>): Heavens!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: You should marry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: I have not the time&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: There is no time like the present.... We
are alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>nervously</i>): Alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Yes; papa and Aunt Susan were discreet
enough to retire. Do not be afraid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Afraid of what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Of proposing to me. If you are, I will propose
to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>aside</i>): I must humor her. But it
is distressing to do so. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Rose</span>.) You would marry
me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Oh, yes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: You like me well enough for that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: I liked you at first sight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: But you have barely an acquaintance
with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: So much the better. If my acquaintance
with you were more intimate, I might not be willing
to marry you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: You can’t love me, however; and
what is marriage without love?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Why can’t I love you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Love, my dear child, love is the
tenderest passion of our nature. It is the flower of
life. It is the affinity of souls. It is&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> (<i>passionately</i>): It is&mdash;it is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>aside</i>): If I could only believe that
she might learn to love me&mdash;that she had not loved
forty other men&mdash;that she was not a monster in the
guise of a siren! Yet I will do my duty, cruel as it is
to me. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Rose</span>.) But your father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Papa has never objected to my loving anybody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Then you have loved somebody
else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Yes, indeed. Eighteen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Eighteen!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Eighteen lost opportunities. You are the
nineteenth. If you refuse to take me, I shall have to
look out for my twentieth. Perhaps you can introduce
me to one of your friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Suppose&mdash;suppose&mdash;I consent to
marry you; that is to say, suppose you consent to
marry me. How can I be sure that you won’t fall in
love with your twentieth&mdash;as you call him&mdash;to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: You can’t be sure. Love has wings like a
bird. Its natural action is flight. How can one help
loving?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>tenderly</i>): I should not wish to
share your love with another man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: I don’t understand you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>aside</i>): This is the most remarkable
case in my experience. The girl is clean daft on
one subject. And yet, somehow, I am half inclined to
take her at her word. I might succeed in curing her
of her mania; I might transform her, create a new
woman in this unhappy spirit; I can not abandon her
to a wretched fate. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Rose</span>.) You say you do not
understand me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: I can’t understand why I should not be allowed
to love whomever I please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: The law declares that you must
love but one husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: As I could only have one husband at a time,
I might still love some one who was not my husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>crossing to</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>and seating himself
next to</i> <span class="smcap">Rose</span>): Don’t you think you could love one
man, whose devotion to you would be tireless, whose
life would be your life, whose thought would be always
for your welfare and happiness; don’t you think you
could love this man, and this man alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> (<i>moving away from him</i>): I never thought
of that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>moving toward her again</i>): Try,
try, my dear child, to see things with my eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: I have a pair of my own, thank you.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Van Hyde</i> (<i>losing himself in his passion</i>): Listen
to me. I <i>do</i> love you, and I want you to love me&mdash;but
not as you love other men. I am anxious to be
your friend, your very best friend. I want you to look
to me as you would look to no one else. I want&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> (<i>changing her manner and laughing</i>): You
play your part admirably, Dr. Van Hyde.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>in astonishment</i>): Play my part!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: You have just asked me to love you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: To accept you as my very best friend?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Then I wish to tell you, sir, that you have
been trifling with me. Your love-making is purely
professional. It is a kind of medicine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>aside</i>): This is a hopeless case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Furthermore, I have convicted you of falsehood.
You never met my father until to-night. You
did meet <i>me</i> last Monday afternoon, in New York, at
2:25 p. m.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Miss Valdingam!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> (<i>courtesying to him</i>): Permit me to thank
you, dear doctor, for your kindness in picking up my
parcels, my parasol, my purse, and myself. I did not
have a chance to thank you while you were performing
that unpleasant duty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Then you remember?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: How could I forget so fascinating an adventure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
although, to be sure, we crazy women are apt to
have defective memories.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>aside</i>): Have I been a fool? (<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Rose</span>.) I may as well confess that, when I saw you for
the first time here to-night, I recognized you. But I
did not suppose that you recognized me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Which proves that you are not so wise a doctor
as you ought to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Really, Miss Valdingam&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Really, Dr. Van Hyde&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: I&mdash;I do not know what to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: I repeat&mdash;you have played your part admirably.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: How can you accuse me of playing
a part?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Sweet duplicity! Did you not come here to
minister to my mind’s disease?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: To meet you&mdash;to learn to know
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Of course. Meanwhile, by way of illustrating
my mania, you made love to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: That is&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: That is&mdash;you played a part. And you were so
successful that, a few minutes ago, you thought I had
fallen in love with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: You embarrass me, Miss Valdingam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: A doctor should never be embarrassed. He
should keep a cool head. His nerves should be steady;
his hand determined. Now, let us be entirely frank.
You wanted to diagnose me&mdash;to analyze me&mdash;perhaps
to hypnotize me. Have I been a good subject?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>awkwardly</i>): An admirable subject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: And, honestly, what do you think of my mania
now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>still more bewildered</i>): It is a
very gentle mania.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: A very gentle mania? Nothing worse than
that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Nothing worse; I am convinced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: You reassure me. But let me tell you, in return,
that I have reason to be grateful to you, Dr. Van
Hyde. It may be that I am matrimonially mad. Many
persons are. Nearly all girls are. But at least I feel
certain that I shall never be confined in an asylum.
You would not let them send me to an asylum, would
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: No! No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Then we can afford to be good friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: The best of friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: We need not talk of love again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>hesitatingly</i>): No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Because, you see, though you are a man, you
are also my doctor; and a patient could not fall in love
with her doctor, could she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Well, it’s not usual.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Then, let me ask you a question. Do you
think my malady&mdash;it is a terrible malady, I suppose&mdash;can
be cured?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: I am sure it can be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Ah! you give me hope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: But you must follow my instructions
carefully. These I will explain to you later. In
the first place, however, you should try to exercise a
certain amount of will power. When you meet a person&mdash;that
is, a man&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: I should hate and despise him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Oh, not so bad as that. You should
avoid him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Avoid him, I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Then you could hardly fall in love
with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Nor marry him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Of course you need amusement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Get as much of it as you can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> (<i>aside</i>): I’m getting it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Meanwhile, I will have a talk with
your father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Papa will do anything for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Then we have little to fear....
Now (<i>he turns to upper</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) I know you must be tired.
This long talk has fatigued you. I will call Mr. Valdingam.
(<i>He is about to open the door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> (<i>suddenly</i>): One moment, please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>turning to her</i>): Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose:</span> Pardon me, I am not in the least fatigued. I
have&mdash;something more to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Indeed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Before you see papa again.... Please
sit down. (<i>He seats himself at</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>She stands leaning
against table at</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) We have had quite an important
little chat, after all, have we not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>gravely</i>): I think it has been important.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose:</span> For me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde:</span> For you, I hope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: And during this conversation, have I had&mdash;any
lucid intervals?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Well, candidly, and though I am
what is called a specialist in brain diseases, I should
regard your mind as perfectly normal and healthy,
except&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Except on the subject of matrimony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Ye-s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Now, suppose I should assure you that I am
not in the least bit insane. Would that be characteristic
of insanity?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Few persons with a mania suspect
their affliction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: I understand. But suppose&mdash;suppose&mdash;you
had been deceived?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>jumping to his feet</i>): Is it possible?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Physicians are deceived sometimes, are they
not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>seating himself</i>): They are only
human.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> (<i>slyly</i>): And you are <i>very</i> human.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>confusedly</i>): I confess it&mdash;to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: That is why, then, you have been so easily
deceived&mdash;to-night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>jumping to his feet again</i>): You
mean?&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: That you have actually been deceived. I
have no mania&mdash;not even a mania to wed all the young
men I meet. (<i>Laughing merrily.</i>) But, of course, you
won’t believe me. My denial is only a symptom of my
dementia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: What can I think? Your father
told me&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Yes, poor papa told you a great many things.
You took it for granted that what he said was said with
reason.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>moving toward her eagerly</i>): And
I have been&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: As patient as a saint with the mad-cap teasing
of a foolish girl, and gently considerate of an old
man’s whims.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>joyfully</i>): Can it be true? Oh,
Miss Valdingam, I begin to look upon myself as the
most ridiculous as well as the happiest of men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: But I could not resist teasing you. And still,
in spite of this confession, I have <i>one</i> mania&mdash;only
one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: A gentle mania?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Very gentle, as you have said. It is love&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>advancing</i>): Love!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> (<i>mischievously</i>): For my father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>disappointedly</i>): Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: He is a good, kind father. Since my mother’s
death I have been his closest companion. Oh, doctor,
I am so happy that you have come to our house.
It is my father who needs your help, your sympathy.
You will give both, I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: It is your father, then&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Who is partially insane. He has been in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
this condition for years. His chief delusion is that I
am insane.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: What a fool I have been!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Do not blame yourself. Have I not done
what I could to convince you that papa had told you
the truth.... Can you forgive me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Forgive <i>you</i>! Can you forgive
<i>me</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Let us forgive each other, then.
(<i>Walking to the window at</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>and looking out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>following her</i>): Miss Valdingam&mdash;I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> (<i>turning and regarding him archly</i>): Be careful,
sir! Perhaps you are even now mistaken. Remember
how cunning we maniacs are!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>aside</i>): I am more than ever in
love with her. How beautiful she is. Sane or insane,
it would be a blessing to possess her. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Rose</span>, <i>nervously</i>.)
Miss Valdingam, may I ask you a question?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> (<i>gently</i>): Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: You remember that when&mdash;when&mdash;I
thought you were not quite&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Balanced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: I had the hardihood&mdash;well&mdash;to
speak to you of love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Certainly. You spoke professionally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: I did <i>not</i> speak professionally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> (<i>looking out of the window</i>): Oh, indeed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: I spoke with sincerity&mdash;from my
heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> (<i>with mock dignity</i>): Sir!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: I must tell you the truth. Since
that day&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> (<i>smiling</i>): Monday at 2:25 p. m.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Don’t laugh at me. I was in earnest
a few moments ago&mdash;I am in earnest now....
I love you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> (<i>with agitation</i>): You love me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: With all my soul. (<i>He seizes her
hand and kisses it.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> (<i>drawing her hand away quickly</i>): Hush!
Some one is coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span> (<i>from behind the door</i>): Can we
come in, doctor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> (<i>in a whisper to the doctor</i>): Pretend that
you do not know the truth, that you are able to cure
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>in a whisper</i>): That I have taken
the case?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: For life?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: We shall see. But speak to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>turning to</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>): Is that you, Mr.
Valdingam? Please come in. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Susan</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span> (<i>eagerly and secretly, to</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Van
Hyde</span>): Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>gravely</i>): I am glad to be able to
assure you, Mr. Valdingam, that my preliminary examination
of your daughter has been entirely satisfactory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span>: Sir, I am overwhelmed with delight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: While your daughter is, without
doubt, suffering from certain delusions&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span> (<i>turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Susan</span>): Do you hear
that, sister?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Her trouble is not far enough advanced
to occasion anxiety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span>: Heaven be praised!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: In fact, I promise you that within
one month her mind will be as clear and vigorous as
your own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span> (<i>grasping the doctor’s hands</i>): Sir,
I regard you as our benefactor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: But you must be very patient and
kind; and, with your permission, I will take charge of
her. My plan is to visit her, here at your house, twice,
or perhaps three or four times a week. You will notice
an improvement in her condition very soon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span>: Have your way, doctor. So long
as my child is saved to me, that is everything. (<i>Turning
to</i> <span class="smcap">Rose</span>.) Rose, my pet, I hear that the doctor and
you have become fast friends already. (<span class="smcap">Rose</span> <i>joins
them at</i> <span class="smcap">L. C.</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span> <i>kisses and fondles
her</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: Oh, yes, papa, Dr. Van Hyde and I are now
very good friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span>: That’s right&mdash;that’s right. Put
your trust in him, my child. He has your interest at
heart.</p>

<p class="ph2">(<span class="smcap">Mr. Valdingam</span> <i>turns gleefully to</i> <span class="smcap">Susan</span>, <i>and the
two converse</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Rose</span>): You hear? He places
you in my care.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: I share his confidence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: And&mdash;may I not hope to be&mdash;your
nineteenth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>: There has not yet been&mdash;a first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span>: Shall we unite then in a study of
agreeable possibilities?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> (<i>archly</i>): Won’t you walk with me in the garden?
See how bright and beautiful the night is!...
Come. Perhaps I may find you&mdash;<i>a rose</i>.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Rose</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Van Hyde</span> <i>exeunt at</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>as the curtain
falls.</i>)</p>
